# Users can still earn from VVVETHStaking without any stakes

## Summary

User can earn VVV tokens from the VVVETHStaking contract even without any stake. 

## Vulnerability Detail

To participate in VVVETHStaking.sol, users will call `stakeETH()` and deposit a certain amount of native tokens.

```solidity
    function stakeEth(
        StakingDuration _stakeDuration
    ) external payable whenStakingIsPermitted returns (uint256) {
        _stakeEth(_stakeDuration, msg.value);
        return stakeId;
    }
```

This will create a mapping of `userStakes[user][stakeID]` for the user.

```solidity
    function _stakeEth(StakingDuration _stakeDuration, uint256 _stakedEthAmount) private {
        if (_stakedEthAmount == 0) revert CantStakeZeroEth();
        ++stakeId;


>       userStakes[msg.sender][stakeId] = StakeData({
            stakedEthAmount: uint224(_stakedEthAmount),
            stakeStartTimestamp: uint32(block.timestamp),
            stakeIsWithdrawn: false,
            stakeDuration: _stakeDuration
        });


>       _userStakeIds[msg.sender].push(stakeId);
```

There is a multiplier depending on the duration of the stake, which is set as such and can be changed by an admin.

```solidity
    ) VVVAuthorizationRegistryChecker(_authorizationRegistryAddress) {
        durationToSeconds[StakingDuration.ThreeMonths] = 90 days;
        durationToSeconds[StakingDuration.SixMonths] = 180 days;
        durationToSeconds[StakingDuration.OneYear] = 360 days;

        durationToMultiplier[StakingDuration.ThreeMonths] = 10_000;
        durationToMultiplier[StakingDuration.SixMonths] = 15_000;
        durationToMultiplier[StakingDuration.OneYear] = 30_000;
    }
```

User can claim their vvv at any point in time through `claimVvv()`, which will be prorated up until the end of the staking duration.

```solidity
    function claimVvv(uint256 _vvvAmount) external {
        if (_vvvAmount == 0) revert CantClaimZeroVvv();

        uint256 claimableVvv = calculateClaimableVvvAmount();
        if (_vvvAmount > claimableVvv) revert InsufficientClaimableVvv();

        userVvvClaimed[msg.sender] += _vvvAmount;

        vvvToken.safeTransfer(msg.sender, _vvvAmount);

        emit VvvClaim(msg.sender, _vvvAmount);
    }
```

The issue lies when the admin decides to increase the multiplier.

PoC:

1. Alice stakes 1 ETH for 3 months. The multiplier is 10000 (100%). After 3 months, Alice withdraws her stake and claims her stake of 1 vVv token.
2. A few weeks later, the protocol decides to increase the multiplier to 20000 for the 3 months option to incentivise new users to stake in their protocol for a short duration.
3. Alice has not participated in the protocol. However, her mapping is still available in the contract. She can call `claimvVv()` even without any stake and get another 1 vVv token immediately because of how claiming is calculated in `calculateAccruedVvvAmount()`

```solidity
  accruedVvv =
                (nominalAccruedEth * ethToVvvExchangeRate() * durationToMultiplier[_stake.stakeDuration]) /
                DENOMINATOR;
        }
```

## Impact

Users can still earn tokens without any token staked.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Recommend setting a fixed multiplier for every new stake, instead of relying on the `durationToMultiplier` mapping which can be changed. This makes sure that changing the `durationToMultiplier` does not affect all past and present stakes, but only future ones.
