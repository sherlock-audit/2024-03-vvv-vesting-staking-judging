# Inflated or deflated rewards to old stakers and  unable to claim rewards  due to an underflow edge case


## Summary

It is not an ADMIN-trusted issue to make it invalid, and it is not related to MEV either, and it is not a future issue to make it invalid. Every action by user or admin is in future. The root cause is that the calculation of accrued rewards uses the latest multiplier instead of the multiplier to be used when the staker stakes.  The multipliers can be changed by admin, and that is the only way to change the exchange rate because the actual exchange rate is 1 and constant forever. So in case of bull/bear market cycles or depending on the market cap of $VVV, the multiplier will be adjusted by admin for the appropriate reward rate to adopt between ETH and $VVV prices.


## Vulnerability Detail

It is stated that exchange rate  will be modified, so only way to modify is by changing the reward multipliers.

1. A staker stakes for 3 months by calling [stakeETH](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-vvv-vesting-staking/blob/2d3540ab8f421055dba60d47e948e1cc55f0a0c7/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/staking/VVVETHStaking.sol#L135)
2. Then he doesn't claim the emitted rewards and waits till the $VVV market cap rises, so now the admin has to control the exchange rate between ETH and VVV, admins call [setDurationMultipliers](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-vvv-vesting-staking/blob/2d3540ab8f421055dba60d47e948e1cc55f0a0c7/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/staking/VVVETHStaking.sol#L264)
3. Now that multiplier is decreased, the rewards to be claimed by that staker will decrease because of the `durationToMultiplier[_stake.stakeDuration]` dependence on the `calculateAccruedVvvAmount` calculation. So this is a clear loss to that staker.
4. So now that $VVV is sent to the staking contract by admin, those unclaimed lost rewards will forever be lost in this contract, and there is no way to recover them except by increasing the multiplier. If you increase it, then it will again cause losses to a few stakers and one's loss is profit to other stakers.
5.  Another situation is that a staker stakes at the peak bull $VVV price, but after 6 months, the price goes low due to the bear market, so admin decides to increase the outflow of rewards, so now that staker can claim more rewards now due to the increased multiplier. And because this staker claimed more, when the current stakers start to claim rewards, they get depleted, and admin has to mint more to compensate for this bad debt.
6. Another issue is the underflow revert at [a - b](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-vvv-vesting-staking/blob/2d3540ab8f421055dba60d47e948e1cc55f0a0c7/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/staking/VVVETHStaking.sol#L250). So `a` can be lower than `b`. When a staker claimed 70% of his rewards, admin reduced the multiplier, so now a calculation uses the current multiplier rather than the multiplier used when he staked. So overflow when `a < b`.


**The impacts of this issue are**


1. underflow reverting when claiming the rewards, and it reverts at [calculateClaimableVvvAmount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-vvv-vesting-staking/blob/2d3540ab8f421055dba60d47e948e1cc55f0a0c7/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/staking/VVVETHStaking.sol#L250)


2. inflated or deflated rewards to the stakers. Loss to old stakers if multipliers are decreased, and loss to new stakers if multipliers are increased, because the old stakers will claim higher rewards and its kind of bad debt, so the last reward claimer will suffer.

## Impact


Giving this High, due to the following impacts: It is not an ADMIN-trusted issue, so it is not invalid, and it is not related to MEV either. The root cause is, the calculation of accrued rewards uses the latest multiplier instead of the multiplier to  be used when the staker stakes.


1. underflow reverting when claiming the rewards, and it reverts at [calculateClaimableVvvAmount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-vvv-vesting-staking/blob/2d3540ab8f421055dba60d47e948e1cc55f0a0c7/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/staking/VVVETHStaking.sol#L250).


2. inflated/deflated rewards to the stakers. Loss to old stakers if multipliers are decreased, and loss to new stakers if multipliers are increased, because the old stakers will claim higher rewards and its kind of bad debt, so the last reward claimer will suffer.

## Tool used


Manual Review


## Recommendation


add an extra storage variable to track the multiplier used by that staker when he stakes.


```diff
    struct StakeData {
        uint224 stakedEthAmount;
        uint32 stakeStartTimestamp;
        bool stakeIsWithdrawn;
        StakingDuration stakeDuration;
+      uint256 durationToMultiplier;
    }
```
