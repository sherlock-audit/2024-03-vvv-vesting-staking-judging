# Potential DoS and users fund locking in Staking

## Summary
Possibility of DoS and temporary blocking of user's funds in VVVETHStaking.sol contract. Occurs because calculateAccruedVvvAmount() relies on the current staking multipliers to calculate the opportunity for staking. And the ability to output Vvv depends on calculateClaimableVvvvAmount() which relies on userVvvvClaimed[msg.sender] which could be written to with old staking multipliers.

## Vulnerability Detail
### Scenario
I'll show you an example of staking for 3 months what exactly the flaw is.

1. Suppose a user stakes X ether for 3 months.
2. At the end of the staking period, he has the option to withdraw X VVV tokens. ((X * 3 / 3) * 1 * multiplier(equals 1000)) / 10000
3. If he withdraws this amount, his value userVvvClaimed[msg.sender] = X.
4. Suppose he staked x ether again for the same 3 months.
5. Now let's finally describe the condition under which the vulnerability appears. Suppose the developers decide to lower the multiplier for staking duration (the setDurationMultipliers function is provided). 
6. Then, to illustrate the error, let's assume that they lowered it by 4 times, from 10000 to 2500. 
7. Now, at the end of the staking period, if the user wants to get new VVVs, his reward will be calculated with the new multiplier and will be equal to. 0.25X for the first staking and 0.25X for the second. However userVvvClaimed[msg.sender] = X. 
8. And in [calculateClaimableVvvvAmount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-vvv-vesting-staking/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/staking/VVVETHStaking.sol#L249) the transaction will be reverted, because we subtract X from 0.25x. 
9. Thus, the user's funds will be blocked until the multiplier increases by a certain value again.

It is worth noting that vulnerability is possible even if the multiplier is not reduced so much. Let's assume that the user first staked X eth for 12 months. Then the first time he will withdraw 3x. And the second time he will withdraw x for 3 months. Then it is enough to decrease the 12-month multiplier by 33 percent (from 30000 to at least 19999) for the vulnerability to occur.

## Impact

The essence of the error is that the calculation of possible branding is made according to the current conditions, but the user could pick up previous awards according to other conditions. If conditions worsen for steakers, there is a significant probability that the group of users who steaked under the previous conditions will end up with blocked funds.

Also, this error can occur not only when the multiplier is changed. The [document](https://hackmd.io/@vvv-knowledge/Syme5HlRT) says that ethToVvvvExchangeRate may change in the future, so if it does so in a similar fashion to the multipliers, the same error may occur.

## Code Snippet
```js
    function claimVvv(uint256 _vvvAmount) external {
        if (_vvvAmount == 0) revert CantClaimZeroVvv();

        uint256 claimableVvv = calculateClaimableVvvAmount();
        if (_vvvAmount > claimableVvv) revert InsufficientClaimableVvv();

        userVvvClaimed[msg.sender] += _vvvAmount;

        vvvToken.safeTransfer(msg.sender, _vvvAmount);

        emit VvvClaim(msg.sender, _vvvAmount);
    }

    function calculateAccruedVvvAmount() public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256[] memory stakeIds = _userStakeIds[msg.sender];
        if (stakeIds.length == 0) return 0;

        uint256 totalVvvAccrued;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < stakeIds.length; ++i) {
            StakeData memory stake = userStakes[msg.sender][stakeIds[i]];
            unchecked {
                totalVvvAccrued += calculateAccruedVvvAmount(stake);
            }
        }

        return totalVvvAccrued;
    }

    function calculateClaimableVvvAmount() public view returns (uint256) {
        return calculateAccruedVvvAmount() - userVvvClaimed[msg.sender];
    }

   function calculateAccruedVvvAmount(StakeData memory _stake) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 stakeDuration = durationToSeconds[_stake.stakeDuration];
        uint256 secondsSinceStakingStarted = block.timestamp - _stake.stakeStartTimestamp;
        uint256 secondsStaked;
        uint256 nominalAccruedEth;
        uint256 accruedVvv;

        unchecked {
            secondsStaked = secondsSinceStakingStarted >= stakeDuration
                ? stakeDuration
                : secondsSinceStakingStarted;

            nominalAccruedEth = (secondsStaked * _stake.stakedEthAmount) / stakeDuration;

            accruedVvv =
                (nominalAccruedEth * ethToVvvExchangeRate() * durationToMultiplier[_stake.stakeDuration]) /
                DENOMINATOR;
        }

        return accruedVvv;
    }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
You can put the multiplier information for a particular item into the StakeData structure and use it when calculating awards.
