# Claimable token amounts are not updated if duration multiplier is modified

## Summary
When duration multiplier is updated, [`calculateClaimableVvvAmount`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-vvv-vesting-staking/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/staking/VVVETHStaking.sol#L222) value may return less or more than user can get, in some edge cases, this may even block user from claiming VVV tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `claimVvv`, the amount users can claim is calculated. The logic for such calculation is simple:

```solidity
    function calculateClaimableVvvAmount() public view returns (uint256) {
        return calculateAccruedVvvAmount() - userVvvClaimed[msg.sender];
    }

```

And for each single stake's accrued amount, is calculated here:

```solidity
    function calculateAccruedVvvAmount(StakeData memory _stake) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 stakeDuration = durationToSeconds[_stake.stakeDuration];
        uint256 secondsSinceStakingStarted = block.timestamp - _stake.stakeStartTimestamp;
        uint256 secondsStaked;
        uint256 nominalAccruedEth;
        uint256 accruedVvv;

        unchecked {
            secondsStaked = secondsSinceStakingStarted >= stakeDuration
                ? stakeDuration
                : secondsSinceStakingStarted;

            nominalAccruedEth = (secondsStaked * _stake.stakedEthAmount) / stakeDuration;

            accruedVvv =
                (nominalAccruedEth * ethToVvvExchangeRate() * durationToMultiplier[_stake.stakeDuration]) /
                DENOMINATOR;
        }

        return accruedVvv;
    }

```

Essentially, the final amount is determined by the duration multiplier. Normally, this is okay, but in the case of multiplier update, this can cause some discrepancies in the final accrued amount. For example, say Bob deposits 10 ETH for three month(90 days), and by default, the multiplier is 10,000 where as the denominator is also 10,000. Ideally, after this 90 days, Bob would be able to claim 10,000 VVVToken in total. But 80 days after Bob's stake, he decides to claim some VVVTokens out and invest in the protocol. With the calculation, Bob claims around 8888 VVVTokens out. After this, the protocol team or admin decides to update the multiplier, the new multiplier of 90 days is 8500. 10 days have passed, and Bob is ready to claim the rest of his VVVTokens, but according to the new calculation, Bob can claim `10000 * 8500 / 10000 = 8500` VVVTokens in total. In `calculateClaimableVvvAmount`, this will be: `8500-8888`, which underflows, and hence the transaction will revert.

The above example is clearly an edge case, but similar things can happen if accrued amount is not updated when multiplier is modified.

## Impact
This will cause discrepancy in how many VVVTokens users can actually get if multiplier is set sometime.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function calculateAccruedVvvAmount(StakeData memory _stake) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 stakeDuration = durationToSeconds[_stake.stakeDuration];
        uint256 secondsSinceStakingStarted = block.timestamp - _stake.stakeStartTimestamp;
        uint256 secondsStaked;
        uint256 nominalAccruedEth;
        uint256 accruedVvv;

        unchecked {
            secondsStaked = secondsSinceStakingStarted >= stakeDuration
                ? stakeDuration
                : secondsSinceStakingStarted;

            nominalAccruedEth = (secondsStaked * _stake.stakedEthAmount) / stakeDuration;

            accruedVvv =
                (nominalAccruedEth * ethToVvvExchangeRate() * durationToMultiplier[_stake.stakeDuration]) /
                DENOMINATOR;
        }

        return accruedVvv;
    }

```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
When multipliers are updated, make sure the old values are calculated and stored somewhere. Such as adding a map to store the timestamp when multipliers are updated, and calculated accrued tokens accordingly.
