# Users can front-run disadvantageous multiplier changes

## Summary

Users are able to front-run admin changes to the duration multiplier


## Vulnerability Detail

Users can monitor the mempool for calls to `setDurationMultipliers()` and front-run changes to multiplier reductions, with calls to `claimVvv()`


## Impact

Attentive users will get the old, possibly much better, rate and be able to claim more than they should be able to, whereas others will be stuck at the new lower rate, even if they had initiated their stakes at the same higher rate.


## Code Snippet

The [setDurationMultiplier](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-vvv-vesting-staking/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/staking/VVVETHStaking.sol#L264) allows the admin to change the rate of unclaimed VVV, but there's no way to prevent users from front-running in `claimVvv()`:

```solidity
// File: contracts/staking/VVVETHStaking.sol : VVVETHStaking.   #1

179        /**
180            @notice Claims $VVV for a user
181            @param _vvvAmount The amount of $VVV to claim
182         */
183        function claimVvv(uint256 _vvvAmount) external {
184            if (_vvvAmount == 0) revert CantClaimZeroVvv();
185    
186            uint256 claimableVvv = calculateClaimableVvvAmount();
187            if (_vvvAmount > claimableVvv) revert InsufficientClaimableVvv();
188    
189            userVvvClaimed[msg.sender] += _vvvAmount;
190    
191            vvvToken.safeTransfer(msg.sender, _vvvAmount);
192    
193            emit VvvClaim(msg.sender, _vvvAmount);
194:       }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review


## Recommendation

Add a `disableClaim()` function, to allow the admin to prevent claiming, while users don't know if the subsequent change to the rate is advantageous or disadvantageous
