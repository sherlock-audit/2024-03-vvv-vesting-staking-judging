# User lose funds if deposit without calling the `VVVETHStaking::stakeEth` function

## Summary

User lose their funds if they deposit ETH in `VVVETHStaking.sol` contract without calling the `VVVETHStaking::stakeEth` function.

## Vulnerability Detail

1. User interact with the protocol and deposit ETH into the `VVVETHStaking.sol` using low level `call` function.
2. The ETH amount is not staked as `VVVETHStaking::stakeEth` function was not called.
3. User will lose their ETH as the `VVVETHStaking` contract will accept the ETH and there's no way to get the ETH back.

- Run this test in `VVVETHStaking.unit.t.sol`

```javascript
    function testUserLosesEthWhenDeposit() public {
        address USER = makeAddr("user");
        uint256 startingBalance = 100 ether;
        vm.deal(USER, startingBalance);
        vm.startPrank(USER);
        // user deposit using low level interaction without calling the stakeEth function
        (bool success,) = address(EthStakingInstance).call{value: startingBalance}("");
        vm.stopPrank();

        uint256[] memory userStakeIds = EthStakingInstance.userStakeIds(USER);

        assert(USER.balance == 0);
        assert(address(EthStakingInstance).balance == startingBalance);
        // user deposited but did not stake
        assert(userStakeIds.length == 0);
    }
```

## Impact

Users loosing their ETH.

```javascript
    ///@notice Fallback function to receive ETH
    receive() external payable {
        emit EtherReceived();
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- Use `receive` function to revert the user transaction
- Dedicate a different function for the ADMIN to deposit

```diff
    receive() external payable {
-       emit EtherReceived();
+       revert();
    }
    .
    .
    .
+   function onlyAdminDeposit() external payable onlyAuthorized{
+       emit EtherReceived();
+   }
```
