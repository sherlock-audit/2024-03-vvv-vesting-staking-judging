# unsafe casting in `VVVETHStaking` may result in overflow

## Summary
In ` VVVETHStaking:stakeEth ` staked amount is casted unsafely from uint256 to uint224. Which can cause staking amount to be different from the correct value.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
   function stakeEth(
        StakingDuration _stakeDuration
    ) external payable whenStakingIsPermitted returns (uint256) {
        _stakeEth(_stakeDuration, msg.value); 
        return stakeId;
    }

    function _stakeEth(StakingDuration _stakeDuration, uint256 _stakedEthAmount) private {
        if (_stakedEthAmount == 0) revert CantStakeZeroEth();
        ++stakeId; 

        userStakes[msg.sender][stakeId] = StakeData({
            stakedEthAmount: uint224(_stakedEthAmount), //@audit-issue unsafe typecasting
            stakeStartTimestamp: uint32(block.timestamp),
            stakeIsWithdrawn: false,
            stakeDuration: _stakeDuration
        });

        _userStakeIds[msg.sender].push(stakeId);

        emit Stake(
            msg.sender,
            stakeId,
            uint224(_stakedEthAmount),
            uint32(block.timestamp),
            _stakeDuration
        );
    }

`_stakedEthAmount` is uint256 amount that is being staked and it has been casted into uint224. if `_stakedEthAmount` is greater than type(uint224).max which is 2**224 - 1, then the accounting will be wrong due to overflow.

Point to note that eth doesn't have supply cap .

Manual Review

## Recommendation

revert if the amount is more than type(uint224).max or remove casting and use uint256. It won't affect much on gas as i believe here uint224 is used to pack uint224 staking amount and uint32 blockstamp
