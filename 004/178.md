# Silent overflow of _stakedEthAmount

## Summary

Performing a narrowing downcast may result in silent overflow due to bit truncation.

## Vulnerability Detail

If a _stakedEthAmount value that is greater than uint224 is passed into the _stakeEth function, downcasting it to uint224 will silently overflow.

## Impact

Silent overflow of _stakedEthAmount

```solidity

    ///@notice Private function to stake ETH, used by both stakeEth and restakeEth
    function _stakeEth(StakingDuration _stakeDuration, uint256 _stakedEthAmount) private {
        if (_stakedEthAmount == 0) revert CantStakeZeroEth();
        ++stakeId;

        userStakes[msg.sender][stakeId] = StakeData({
            stakedEthAmount: uint224(_stakedEthAmount), // unsafe downcasting
            stakeStartTimestamp: uint32(block.timestamp),
            stakeIsWithdrawn: false,
            stakeDuration: _stakeDuration
        });

        _userStakeIds[msg.sender].push(stakeId);

        emit Stake(
            msg.sender,
            stakeId,
            uint224(_stakedEthAmount),
            uint32(block.timestamp),
            _stakeDuration
        );
    }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

use OpenZeppelinâ€™s SafeCast library when casting from uint256 to uint224.
