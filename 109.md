# User is unable to withdraw ETH before the stakeDuration has expired.

## Summary
Users are unable to withdraw their stake under any circumstances before the `stakeDuration` has elapsed.

## Vulnerability Detail
The current protocol locks user stakes for the duration specified by `stakeDuration`, disallowing early withdrawals. 
This can be seen in the `_withdrawChecks` function, which is part of the `withdrawStake` function:

```solidity
function _withdrawChecks(StakeData memory _stake) private view {
        if (_stake.stakedEthAmount == 0) revert InvalidStakeId();
        if (_stake.stakeIsWithdrawn) revert StakeIsWithdrawn();
        if (block.timestamp < _stake.stakeStartTimestamp + durationToSeconds[_stake.stakeDuration]) {
            revert CantWithdrawBeforeStakeDuration();
        }
    }
```

While this is the way staking works, unforeseen circumstances can arise where users urgently need to unstake. For instance, sudden spikes in ETH price might make the the user want to sell it, or emergencies may require immediate access to funds. Therefore, it's imperative that users have the flexibility to withdraw their stake at any time against some penalty fee and loss of interest as this is the standard behavior and most of the protocols operate this way.

While users are typically informed about the stake duration, unexpected events can occur, necessitating flexibility. It's crucial not to impose unnecessary constraints on users' access to their staked funds.

## Impact
The inability to withdraw stakes prematurely can have severe consequences for users, particularly during emergencies. This restriction may deter users from participating in the protocol altogether, impacting its adoption and success.

Additionally, raising this concern with the sponsors revealed a flawed solutionâ€”users being directed to create a ticket in the Discord channel for manual withdrawal by admins. However, this workaround presents significant flaws:

- Even if an admin facilitates a withdrawal, the stake remains active, enabling the user to withdraw again after the stakeDuration has passed.
 - The active stake also allows the user to continue accruing interest, leading to potential exploitation and loss for the protocol.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address these concerns, it's recommended to implement an early withdrawal mechanism presenting some penalty fee. This mechanism would provide users with the necessary flexibility while safeguarding the integrity and stability of the protocol.
