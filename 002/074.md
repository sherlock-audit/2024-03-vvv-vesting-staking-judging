# Potential Loss of Unclaimed Vested Tokens upon Vesting Schedule Removal

## Summary
The `VVVVesting` contract includes a `function:: removeVestingSchedule` that allows administrators to remove a user's vesting schedule. The vested tokens that have not yet been claimed by the user could become inaccessible if their vesting schedule is removed. This action could result in the loss of tokens that the user has rightfully earned according to the vesting terms.

## Vulnerability Detail
```javascript
 function removeVestingSchedule(
        address _vestedUser,
        uint256 _vestingScheduleIndex
    ) external onlyAuthorized {
        delete userVestingSchedules[_vestedUser][_vestingScheduleIndex];
        emit RemoveVestingSchedule(_vestedUser, _vestingScheduleIndex);
    }
```

## Impact
If a vesting schedule is removed before a user has claimed their vested tokens, the user may be unable to claim their remaining tokens, effectively forfeiting them. This could lead to loss of trust in the platform.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

the Protocol should make arrangements for users to claim their vested tokens before removing a vesting schedule. This ensures that users receive the benefits they are entitled to and that the process is handled fairly and transparently.
