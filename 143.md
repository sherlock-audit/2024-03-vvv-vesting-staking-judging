# the function setPermission doesn't grant the user role correctly

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-vvv-vesting-staking/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/auth/VVVAuthorizationRegistry.sol#L45
## Summary
when setting`setPermission` in the `VVVAuthourizationRegistry` contract, it doesn't call the `_setRoleAdmin` in `AcessControl.sol` to set `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` as the roleAdmin. without a roleAdmin that permission role cannot be granted to a new user.

## Vulnerability Detail

without a `roleAdmin` set for the newly created permission, there is no way to grant that new permission to a user.
therefore all calls with the modifier `onlyAuthorized` will fail.

## Impact
all calls with the modifier `onlyAuthorized` will always fail because that role cannot be assigned to a new user without a roleAdmin

## Code Snippet

the modifier
```solidity
modifier onlyAuthorized() {
        if (!_registry.isAuthorized(address(this), msg.sig, msg.sender)) {
            revert UnauthorizedCaller();
        }
        _;
    }
```
checks the registry function
```solidity
function isAuthorized(
        address _contractToCall,
        bytes4 _functionSelector,
        address _caller
    ) external view returns (bool) {
        bytes24 key = _keyFromAddressAndSelector(_contractToCall, _functionSelector);
        bytes32 requiredRole = permissions[key];
        return hasRole(requiredRole, _caller);
    }
```
which in turn calls the function inherited from `AcessControl` to confirm the user role
```solidity
function hasRole(bytes32 role, address account) public view virtual returns (bool) {
        return _roles[role].hasRole[account];
    }
```
however when setting the permission with the `setPermission` function, there is no address set as the roleAdmin for the permission so it is impossible to grant anybody the role.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
change the `setPermission` to
```solidity
function setPermission(
        address _contract,
        bytes4 _functionSelector,
        bytes32 _role
    ) external onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
        bytes24 key = _keyFromAddressAndSelector(_contract, _functionSelector);
        permissions[key] = _role;
        _setRoleAdmin(role, DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE);
    }
```
