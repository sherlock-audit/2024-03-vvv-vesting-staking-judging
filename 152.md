# Division by Zero and Immediate Vesting Due to Zero Interval Length

## Summary
The vesting contract does not prevent the setting of a vesting schedule with an interval length of zero, which can cause division by zero errors in the calculation of vested amounts and result in the immediate vesting of all tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
- Current Implementation: The `setVestingSchedule` and `_setVestingSchedule` functions allow for the creation of vesting schedules without validating the interval length.

- Issue: If the interval length is set to zero, it could lead to division by zero when calculating the number of elapsed intervals in `getVestedAmount`. Additionally, it can be interpreted as all tokens being immediately vested, which is likely not the intended behavior.

### PoC 
- Alice, an administrator, sets a vesting schedule for Bob with a zero interval length, which is accepted by the contract:
```solidity
vestingContract.setVestingSchedule(
    bobAddress,
    0, // First schedule for Bob
    1000, // Tokens to vest at start
    10000, // Tokens to vest after first interval
    0, // Amount already withdrawn
    futureStartTime,
    futureCliffEndTime,
    0, // Interval length set to zero
    12, // Max intervals
    5 * 10**16 // 5% growth rate proportion
);

```
- Bob can now potentially withdraw all tokens immediately, as the interval length of zero may bypass the intended vesting period calculations.

## Impact
Setting a zero interval length undermines the vesting mechanism, allowing beneficiaries to potentially withdraw the entire balance immediately, rather than over the intended vesting period. 
This could lead to a rapid dilution of token value and could be exploited to circumvent vesting restrictions.

```solidity

    address _vestedUser,
    uint256 _vestingScheduleIndex,
    uint88 _tokensToVestAtStart,
    uint120 _tokensToVestAfterFirstInterval,
    uint128 _vestingScheduleAmountWithdrawn,
    uint32 _vestingScheduleStartTime,
    uint32 _vestingScheduleCliffEndTime,
    uint32 _vestingScheduleIntervalLength,
    uint16 _vestingScheduleMaxIntervals,
    uint64 _vestingScheduleGrowthRateProportion
) external onlyAuthorized {
    // No validation for interval length > 0
    // ...
    _setVestingSchedule(params);
}

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Introduce a check in both setVestingSchedule and _setVestingSchedule to ensure that the interval length (_vestingScheduleIntervalLength) is strictly greater than zero.
- Provide clear error messages to inform the user when the interval length is invalid, enhancing the contract's usability and safety.
