# Updating a current vesting schedule may result on a DoS on `withdrawVestedTokens`

## Summary

The function `setVestingSchedule` within the contract `VVVVesting` aims to create or update a vesting schedule. When an active vesting schedule is updated resulting in lower accrued tokens over time, it may cause a DoS at the function `withdrawVestedTokens`, preventing users from claiming their vested tokens. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `setVestingSchedule` is for creating or updating a vesting schedule. When an active schedule is updated resulting in a lower amount of tokens accrued over time, it may cause a DoS at the function `withdrawVestedTokens`:

```solidity
    function withdrawVestedTokens(
        uint128 _tokenAmountToWithdraw,
        address _tokenDestination,
        uint256 _vestingScheduleIndex
    ) external {
        VestingSchedule[] storage vestingSchedules = userVestingSchedules[msg.sender];

        if (_vestingScheduleIndex >= vestingSchedules.length) {
            revert InvalidScheduleIndex();
        }

        VestingSchedule storage vestingSchedule = vestingSchedules[_vestingScheduleIndex];

        if (
            _tokenAmountToWithdraw >
>>          getVestedAmount(msg.sender, _vestingScheduleIndex) - vestingSchedule.tokenAmountWithdrawn
        ) {
            revert AmountIsGreaterThanWithdrawable();
        }

        // ...
    }
```

When an active vesting schedule is updated, it could result in a lower value being returned from calling `getVestedAmount`. When the user has already claimed some tokens from that vesting schedule, `vestingSchedule.tokenAmountWithdrawn` will be bigger than `getVestedAmount`, causing a DoS on the function.

## Impact

When an active vesting schedule is updated and the user has already claimed some tokens from that schedule, it may result in a DoS on `withdrawVestedTokens`, preventing users from claiming more tokens.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Is recommended to not allow updating a vesting schedule that already has some claimed tokens.
