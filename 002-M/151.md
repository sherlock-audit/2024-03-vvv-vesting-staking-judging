# claimVvv() may fail due to exceed gas limit

## Summary

claimVvv() requires going over all stakeIds of a user which is an unbounded loop, and this may fail due to exceed gas limit.

## Vulnerability Detail

Calling `claimVvv()` requires calling `calculateAccruedVvvAmount()`, which needs to go over all `stakeIds` of user, even if a stakeId has already finished claiming. This may cause exceed gas limit if a user has staked many entries.


```solidity
    function claimVvv(uint256 _vvvAmount) external {
        if (_vvvAmount == 0) revert CantClaimZeroVvv();

        uint256 claimableVvv = calculateClaimableVvvAmount();
        if (_vvvAmount > claimableVvv) revert InsufficientClaimableVvv();

        userVvvClaimed[msg.sender] += _vvvAmount;

        vvvToken.safeTransfer(msg.sender, _vvvAmount);

        emit VvvClaim(msg.sender, _vvvAmount);
    }

    /**
        @notice Returns accrued $VVV for a user based on their staking activity
        @dev Does not account for any claimed tokens
        @return $VVV accrued
     */
    function calculateAccruedVvvAmount() public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256[] memory stakeIds = _userStakeIds[msg.sender];
        if (stakeIds.length == 0) return 0;

        uint256 totalVvvAccrued;
>       for (uint256 i = 0; i < stakeIds.length; ++i) {
>           StakeData memory stake = userStakes[msg.sender][stakeIds[i]];
>           unchecked {
>               totalVvvAccrued += calculateAccruedVvvAmount(stake);
>           }
>       }

        return totalVvvAccrued;
    }
```

## Impact

Users may not be able to claim their vvv tokens due to too many entries.

## Tool used

Manual review

## Recommendation

1. Split stakeIds that are already mature or already claimed from the ones that are still in progress.
2. Add the option to claim vvv from a specific stakeId.
