# Out of gas error on VVV accrual

## Summary

When VVV accrual is calculated, we iterate through all of a user's stakes. This, however, could lead to out of gas error when the user has lots of stakes. 

## Vulnerability Detail

Here is the `calculateAccruedVvvAmount` function: 

```solidity
    function calculateAccruedVvvAmount() public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256[] memory stakeIds = _userStakeIds[msg.sender];
        if (stakeIds.length == 0) return 0;

        uint256 totalVvvAccrued;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < stakeIds.length; ++i) {
            StakeData memory stake = userStakes[msg.sender][stakeIds[i]];
            unchecked {
                totalVvvAccrued += calculateAccruedVvvAmount(stake);
            }
        }

        return totalVvvAccrued;
    }
```

Lets say that `stakeIds.length` is very large (e.g. 100,000) due to the user staking and/or restaking many times. The gas limit on Avalanche C chain is currently 15 million. Then `calculateAccruedVvvAmount` will run out of gas. This will cause claiming VVV to automatically revert because the amount of claimable VVV cannot be calculated within the gas limit. 

## Impact

User will possibly not be able to claim VVV

Store a pointer tracking which accruals have already been processed
