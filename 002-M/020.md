# Unbound gas usage of ````VVVETHStaking.claimVvv()````

## Summary
In current design of ````VVVETHStaking```` contract, users' history staking records are never deleted, all records would be traversed to ````calculateClaimableVvvAmount()````. The gas cost of ````claimVvv()```` might be higher and higher, and finally become unacceptable.

## Vulnerability Detail
To get one staking record from storage, there are 3 ````SLOAD```` operations (````1```` for L202, and ````2```` for L207 ), as ````SLOAD```` costs ````2000```` gas, reading one staking record costs ````6K+```` gas. Let's say, there are 100 history records, then the user needs to pay ````600K+```` gas to ````claimVvv()```` every time. It's a heavily burden for users to interact with the protocol, especially the protocol is intended to be deployed on the Ethereum mainnet.

File: contracts\staking\VVVETHStaking.sol
36:     struct StakeData {
37:         uint224 stakedEthAmount;
38:         uint32 stakeStartTimestamp; // @audit slot 0
39:         bool stakeIsWithdrawn;
40:         StakingDuration stakeDuration; // @audit slot 1
41:     }

...
186:         uint256 claimableVvv = calculateClaimableVvvAmount();
...
194:     }

File: contracts\staking\VVVETHStaking.sol
249:     function calculateClaimableVvvAmount() public view returns (uint256) {
250:         return calculateAccruedVvvAmount() - userVvvClaimed[msg.sender];
251:     }

File: contracts\staking\VVVETHStaking.sol
201:     function calculateAccruedVvvAmount() public view returns (uint256) {
202:         uint256[] memory stakeIds = _userStakeIds[msg.sender]; // @audit costs 2K per stakeId
...
206:         for (uint256 i = 0; i < stakeIds.length; ++i) {
207:             StakeData memory stake = userStakes[msg.sender][stakeIds[i]]; // @audit costs 4K per StakeData
208:             unchecked {
209:                 totalVvvAccrued += calculateAccruedVvvAmount(stake);
210:             }
211:         }
212: 
...
214:     }

```

## Impact

````delete```` staking record when its finished.
