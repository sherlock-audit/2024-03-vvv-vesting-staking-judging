# Denial of service while claiming $VVV tokens

## Summary

The array of user's stake IDs grows indefinitely when using the `stake` and `restake` functions. This can lead to a scenario where the array grows to a size where it becomes impossible to iterate over all of it due to an out-of-gas error.

## Vulnerability Detail

With every `stake` and `restake`, the array that holds [the user's stake IDs grows](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-vvv-vesting-staking/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/staking/VVVETHStaking.sol#L301). To calculate the amount of accrued $VVV, the [`calculateAccruedVvvAmount`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-vvv-vesting-staking/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/staking/VVVETHStaking.sol#L201-L211) function iterates over all user's stake IDs, leading to a scenario where at some point the array might become so large that it becomes impossible to iterate over all of them due to an out-of-gas error.

## Impact

Denial of service while claiming $VVV tokens through `claimVvv` function.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to redesign the contract logic so that it is not necessary to iterate over the entire array. Instead, consider enabling the `claimVvv` function to specify an index and length for better efficiency.
