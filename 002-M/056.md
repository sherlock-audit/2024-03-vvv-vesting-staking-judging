# Abstract Wallet users may encounter DoS when claiming VVVTokens.

## Summary
When users are using abstract wallets to stake in the protocol, the chance for DoS to happen in [`claimVvv`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-vvv-vesting-staking/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/staking/VVVETHStaking.sol#L183) high.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `claimVvv`, accrued VVVTokens are calculated in `calculateAccruedVvvAmount`. This function loops through all stakes owned by user and add up each stake's accrued amount, and return the total value.

```solidity
    function calculateAccruedVvvAmount() public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256[] memory stakeIds = _userStakeIds[msg.sender];
        if (stakeIds.length == 0) return 0;

        uint256 totalVvvAccrued;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < stakeIds.length; ++i) {
            StakeData memory stake = userStakes[msg.sender][stakeIds[i]];
            unchecked {
                totalVvvAccrued += calculateAccruedVvvAmount(stake);
            }
        }

        return totalVvvAccrued;
    }
```

In `VVVETHStaking` contract, `userStakes` are only pushed but not popped, which means the list length can only increase but not decrease. Considering most users won't stake many times so this won't cause any issues, but for users who use abstract wallets, the same address may be used many times, and when this happens, the loop length will be considerable long. This will cause too many gases being consumed, and eventually may cause OOG and DoS for abstract wallets which have a lot stakes in the protocol.

## Impact
Abstract wallet users may experience DoS when trying to claim VVVTokens.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function calculateAccruedVvvAmount() public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256[] memory stakeIds = _userStakeIds[msg.sender];
        if (stakeIds.length == 0) return 0;

        uint256 totalVvvAccrued;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < stakeIds.length; ++i) {
            StakeData memory stake = userStakes[msg.sender][stakeIds[i]];
            unchecked {
                totalVvvAccrued += calculateAccruedVvvAmount(stake);
            }
        }

        return totalVvvAccrued;
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
When a stake is withdrawn or restaked, pop them from the list, and before doing so, make sure the accrued VVVTokens are also claimed by users.
