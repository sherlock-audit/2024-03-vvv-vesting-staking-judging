# User will lose VVV if creates too much stakes

## Summary
To claim VVV from staking, it loops through all user's stakes. At some point it will reach `blockGasLimit` when there are too much stakes. As a result, VVV can't be claimed due to out-of-gas error

## Vulnerability Detail
It loops through every stake
```solidity
    function calculateAccruedVvvAmount() public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256[] memory stakeIds = _userStakeIds[msg.sender];
        if (stakeIds.length == 0) return 0;

        uint256 totalVvvAccrued;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < stakeIds.length; ++i) {
            StakeData memory stake = userStakes[msg.sender][stakeIds[i]];
            unchecked {
                totalVvvAccrued += calculateAccruedVvvAmount(stake);
            }
        }

        return totalVvvAccrued;
    }
```

## Impact
User can be unable to claim VVV from staking
