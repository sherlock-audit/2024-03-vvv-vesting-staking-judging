# DOS in calculating VVV accrueed Amount.

## Summary
calculateAccruedVvvAmount calculates the total VVV accrued amount by looping through the length of stakeIds. The problem is that there is no upper bound on the length of stakeIds  and iterating over them is costly and can result in gas cost that is over block gas limit.Leading to a state of DOS where acrued VVV amount can't be calculated.
## Vulnerability Detail
When calculating accrued VVV token amount the function below will loop over all the stake Ids.
```@solidity
    function calculateAccruedVvvAmount() public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256[] memory stakeIds = _userStakeIds[msg.sender];
        if (stakeIds.length == 0) return 0;

        uint256 totalVvvAccrued;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < stakeIds.length; ++i) {
            StakeData memory stake = userStakes[msg.sender][stakeIds[i]];
            unchecked {
                totalVvvAccrued += calculateAccruedVvvAmount(stake);
            }
        }

        return totalVvvAccrued;
    }
```
When the loop is large it will become expensive to iterate through the array since gas limit will be more than block gas limit, leading to a Denial Of service state.
## Impact
Accrued VVV cant be calculated

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Limit the length of Stake ids or delete stake ids on unstaking to prevent the loop from reaching gas cost more than block gas limit.
