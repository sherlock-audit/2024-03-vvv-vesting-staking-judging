# Improper Validation of Start and Cliff Times Leading to Immediate Token Access

## Summary
The vesting contract lacks necessary validation for the start time and cliff end time of vesting schedules. This allows administrators to set past timestamps, resulting in schedules that are immediately vested and accessible, contrary to the intended vesting logic.


## Vulnerability Detail
- `Current Implementation`: The `VVVVesting` contract provides functions `setVestingSchedule` and `_setVestingSchedule` to establish vesting schedules for users. These functions accept parameters for the start time `(scheduleStartTime)` and the end time of the cliff period `(cliffEndTime)`. 

- `Issue`: There are no checks to ensure that the provided `scheduleStartTime` and `cliffEndTime` are in the future. As a result, if these parameters are set to past timestamps, the vesting schedule would be considered as already started or even completed, allowing immediate withdrawal of all vested tokens.
### PoC
- Suppose Alice is an administrator who can set vesting schedules, and Bob is a beneficiary. 
- Alice sets a vesting schedule for Bob with a start time and cliff time that have already passed:
```solidity
// Hypothetical timestamps for demonstration
uint32 pastStartTime = 1619827200; // Equivalent to May 1, 2021
uint32 pastCliffEndTime = 1622505600; // Equivalent to June 1, 2021

// Alice sets the vesting schedule for Bob
vestingContract.setVestingSchedule(
    bobAddress,
    0, // First schedule for Bob
    1000, // Tokens to vest at start
    10000, // Tokens to vest after first interval
    0, // Amount already withdrawn
    pastStartTime,
    pastCliffEndTime,
    30 days, // Interval length
    12, // Max intervals
    5 * 10**16 // 5% growth rate proportion
);
```
- Bob can now immediately withdraw all the tokens that were supposed to be vested over a year because the start and cliff times are in the past.
- Since _setVestingSchedule is the function that actually updates the storage with the new schedule, the absence of checks directly affects the stored vesting schedules.


## Impact
- The immediate availability of all vested tokens undermines the purpose of the vesting schedule, which is to release tokens gradually over time. 
- This could lead to a sudden oversupply of tokens on the market, potentially affecting the token's value and the project's economy. 
- It also violates the agreed-upon vesting terms between the token issuer and the beneficiaries.

```solidity

        uint256 _vestingScheduleIndex,
        uint88 _tokensToVestAtStart,
        uint120 _tokensToVestAfterFirstInterval,
        uint128 _vestingScheduleAmountWithdrawn,
        uint32 _vestingScheduleStartTime,
        uint32 _vestingScheduleCliffEndTime,
        uint32 _vestingScheduleIntervalLength,
        uint16 _vestingScheduleMaxIntervals,
        uint64 _vestingScheduleGrowthRateProportion
    ) external onlyAuthorized { 
          // ......   
      _setVestingSchedule(params);
 }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. **Input Validation:**
   - Add checks within both `setVestingSchedule` and `_setVestingSchedule` to ensure that `scheduleStartTime` and `cliffEndTime` are strictly greater than the current block timestamp.
