# Incorrect Configuration of Vesting Schedule parameters can lead to loss of functionality.


## Summary

impact: High
likelihood: low (as admin is trusted)

It is a necessary condition that `_vestingScheduleCliffEndTime` should be greater than or equal to `_vestingScheduleStartTime`.


## Vulnerability Detail
While centralization risk is acknowledged and Admin is trusted by the team, In `function:: setVestingSchedule` the `_vestingScheduleCliffEndTime` could be set to a value that is earlier than `_vestingScheduleStartTime` (by error/mistake), which could lead to 
-  immediate vesting of tokens that should be locked during the cliff period
-  incorrect calculations of vested amounts. 
This inconsistency can cause an issue with the contract, not merely a Admin Privilege.

## Impact
when `_vestingScheduleCliffEndTime` is set incorrectly, it causes:
 - premature release of tokens, incorrect calculations of vested amounts, affecting the token economy and potentially leading to loss of funds for the project.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
-  Implement  additional checks in setVestingSchedule function,  to ensure that `_vestingScheduleCliffEndTime` is always greater than or equal to `_vestingScheduleStartTime`.
 for example: `require(_vestingScheduleCliffEndTime >= _vestingScheduleStartTime, "Cliff end time must be after schedule start time");`
