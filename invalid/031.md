# Modifier `onlyAuthorized` works well only with external functions

## Summary
`msg.sig` for public and external functions can be different.

## Vulnerability Detail
`onlyAuthorized` modifier can sometimes doesn't work as expected. It checks if user is authorized for `msg.sig`, but `msg.sig` checks if you're authorized only for first function called.

Between external and public functions is difference. External functions on each call make new `msg.sig`, but for public functions that are called from within same contract that doesn't happen. It looks more like this:

1. User calls function A with `onlyAuthorized`
2. Function A has inside function B with `onlyAuthorized`
3. Function B `onlyAuthorized` is using `msg.sig` from function A.


Example to test function selectors:
```solidity

pragma solidity ^0.8.0; 
contract TestMsgSig { 
  event log(bytes4);
  
  function setFeePublic(uint256) public  {
       emit log(this.setFeePublic.selector);
       emit log(msg.sig);
  }
  
  function setFeeExternal(uint256) external  {
       emit log(this.setFeeExternal.selector);
       emit log(msg.sig);
  }
  
  function TestPublic() public {
      setFeePublic(2);
  }
  
  function TestExternal() public {
     this.setFeeExternal(2);
  }

}
```

## Impact
Currently doesn't exist function which have inside another function with `onlyAuthorized` modifier (the closest one you can get is [mint](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-vvv-vesting-staking/blob/2d3540ab8f421055dba60d47e948e1cc55f0a0c7/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/tokens/VvvToken.sol#L25-L27)), but it can impact future changes.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation

Change modifier to accept current modifier as parameter

```diff
-   modifier onlyAuthorized() {
+   modifier onlyAuthorized(bytes4 functionSelector)
-    if (!_registry.isAuthorized(address(this), msg.sig, msg.sender)) {
+   if (!_registry.isAuthorized(address(this), functionSelector, msg.sender)) {
        revert UnauthorizedCaller();
    }
    _;
}
```

Example of how it would look like:
```solidity
function mint(address _to, uint256 _amount) public onlyAuthorized(this.mint.selector) {
    _mint(_to, _amount);
}
```
