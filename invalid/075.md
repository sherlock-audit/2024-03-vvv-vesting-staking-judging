# Denial Of Service in Staking contract.

## Summary
The `VVVETHStaking::receive()` function is vulnerable to DoS attacks. An attacker can send low-gas transactions that clog the network even if they fail, hindering legitimate transactions adn sometime even DOS.

## Vulnerability Detail
Link: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-vvv-vesting-staking/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/staking/VVVETHStaking.sol#L120
-  The attacker sends numerous transactions to the contract's receive function with a very low gas price(This price is insufficient to cover the actual cost of executing the receive function (including event emission).
-  Despite failing, each transaction still consumes some minimal gas on the network, hence DOS.

## Impact
-  If the attacker sends a large number of such transactions, the cumulative gas consumption can congest the network, making it difficult or expensive for legitimate transactions to be processed. This disrupts normal network operations and some users fill face *_Transaction reverting_* issue

## Code Snippet
If contract is deployed on etherum chain- 
**Scenario 1:** Gas Limit Exhaustion (Low Network Congestion)
**Assumptions:**

> **Attacker gas price:** 1 Gwei (very low, typical gas price for Ethereum can be higher)
> **Average gas price:** 20 Gwei
> **Cost of receive function execution (including event emission):** 21,000 gas
> **Network congestion:** Low
**Analysis:**

Similar to the Avalanche scenario, the attacker cannot afford a complete transaction with their gas price. However, let's assume failed transactions still consume 1,000 gas.

**DoS Attempt:**

The attacker sends a large number of transactions (let's say 200) with a gas limit of 1 Gwei each.

**Impact:**

Each transaction consumes 1,000 gas, even though it fails due to insufficient gas.
This results in a total gas consumption of 200,000 gas (200 transactions * 1,000 gas/transaction).
While not a major impact in isolation, a sustained attack with many transactions could start affecting legitimate transactions on the network and hence DOS.

**Scenario 2:** Gas Limit Exhaustion (High Network Congestion)
**Assumptions:**

> **Attacker gas price:** 10 Gwei (assuming higher gas price due to attacker strategy)
> **Average gas price (due to congestion):** 40 Gwei
> **Cost of receive function execution:** 21,000 gas
> **Network congestion:** High
> **Analysis:**

In this congested scenario, the attacker can afford transactions with a higher gas price (10 Gwei) but still not enough to execute the receive function (21,000 gas).

**DoS Attempt:**

The attacker sends a large number of transactions (let's say 100) with a gas limit set at their gas price (10 Gwei).

**Impact:**

Even though the transactions fail, they consume some gas on the network (let's assume 3,000 gas per failed transaction due to higher congestion).
This results in a total gas consumption of 300,000 gas (100 transactions * 3,000 gas/transaction).
Due to congestion, this additional gas consumption can significantly impact the network, delaying or preventing legitimate transactions.
> Same vulnerability will also exist on **_Avalanche-C_** chain
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
-  Implement checks in the receive function to reject transactions with gas limits below a certain threshold.
