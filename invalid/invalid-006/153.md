# Overflow Risk Due to Unchecked Growth Rates in Vesting Calculations

## Summary
The vesting contract does not enforce limits on the growth rate for vesting schedules, which can lead to arithmetic overflow in vesting calculations, resulting in incorrect and unpredictable vesting amounts.

## Vulnerability Detail
- Current Implementation: The `setVestingSchedule` and `_setVestingSchedule` functions allow administrators to set vesting schedules with a growth rate parameter, which is used in the `calculateVestedAmountAtInterval` function.

- Issue: High growth rates, when compounded over several intervals, can cause arithmetic overflow in the vesting calculation, leading to incorrect vesting amounts that can be either too high or wrap around to small values.

### PoC 
An administrator sets a vesting schedule with an excessively high growth rate, which the contract accepts:
```solidity
vestingContract.setVestingSchedule(
    userAddress,
    0, // Schedule index
    1000, // Tokens to vest at start
    10000, // Tokens to vest after first interval
    0, // Amount already withdrawn
    futureStartTime,
    futureCliffEndTime,
    30 days, // Interval length
    12, // Max intervals
    10**18 // 100% growth rate proportion, leading to overflow
);
```
This could result in the `calculateVestedAmountAtInterval` function returning incorrect amounts due to overflow.


## Impact
Overflow in vesting calculations can lead to beneficiaries either receiving far fewer tokens than expected or an excessively large amount, potentially draining the contract's token balance.

## Code Snippet
- https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-vvv-vesting-staking/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vesting/VVVVesting.sol#L273
```solidity
function calculateVestedAmountAtInterval(
    uint256 _firstIntervalAccrual,
    uint256 _elapsedIntervals,
    uint256 _growthRateProportion
) public pure returns (uint256) {
    if (_growthRateProportion == 0 || _elapsedIntervals == 0) {
        return _firstIntervalAccrual * _elapsedIntervals;
    } else {
        uint256 r;
        uint256 rToN;
        uint256 Sn;
        unchecked {
            // Convert growth rate proportion to a fixed-point number with 1e18 scale
            r = FixedPointMathLib.divWadDown(
                _growthRateProportion + FixedPointMathLib.WAD,
                FixedPointMathLib.WAD
            );

            // Calculate r^n
            rToN = FixedPointMathLib.rpow(r, _elapsedIntervals, FixedPointMathLib.WAD);

            // Calculate the sum of the geometric series
            Sn = _firstIntervalAccrual.mulWadDown((rToN - FixedPointMathLib.WAD)).divWadDown(
                r - FixedPointMathLib.WAD
            );
        }
        return Sn;
    }
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Introduce validation in setVestingSchedule and _setVestingSchedule to ensure that the growth rate is within a reasonable range that will not cause overflow during calculations.
- Utilize `SafeMath` or similar libraries to perform arithmetic operations within `calculateVestedAmountAtInterval`
