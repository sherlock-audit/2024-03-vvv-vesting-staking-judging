# attacker(user) can steal/drain vvvToken from VVVETHStaking contract.

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Let’s assume, alice’s _stake.stakeStartTimestamp = 1 January and  StakingDuration = 3 months.

2. Alice calls the function claimVvv on January 30.so Alice will get  vvvToken as reward for (january 30 - january 1) = 30 days.

3. After That, Alice again calls the function claimVvv on January 30.so Alice will again get  vvvToken as reward for (january 30 - january 1) = 30 days.

4. As there is no accounting/preventing mechanism for previous time period reward accumulation , so Alice(attacker) can call the  function claimVvv multiple times and drain rewards from the  VVVETHStaking contract.

## Impact
attacker(user) can steal/drain vvvToken from VVVETHStaking contract.
