# Mint Will Not Take Place If Authorised Address For Mint Is A Contract

## Summary

The authorisation logic used in the system is based on the function being called , if the msg.sender is not authorised for the msg.sig
then the tx would revert.  But this can be erroneous under a certain condition.


## Vulnerability Detail

1.) If functionA calls functionB and functionB uses the `onlyAuthorised` modifier then the msg.sig that will be used in the modifier will
be of function A and not functionB (only for public functions not external).

2.) Let's take an example of mint function here https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-vvv-vesting-staking/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/tokens/VvvToken.sol#L25

```solidity
function mint(address _to, uint256 _amount) public onlyAuthorized {
        _mint(_to, _amount);
    }
```

3.) Let's say the address authorised to call the above mint function is a contract (say contractB) , the contract invokes mint of VvvToken via a mint function of it's own , let's say this function in the authorised contractB is mintA()

4.) When this contractB invokes the mint in VvvToken.sol the `onlyAuthorised`modifier is run and it checks the msg.sig , instead of msg.sig of the VvvToken.sol's mint the msg.sig would be of the contractB's mint and the call would revert since authorisation is done
for msg.sig of the mint function in VvvToken.sol.


## Impact

The onlyAuthorised modifier would revert in the above case since it would check msg.sig of the mint function in the authorised contract rather than of the mint in VVVToken contract.
