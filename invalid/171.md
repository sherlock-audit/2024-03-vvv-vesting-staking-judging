# Admin Can Fail to Update newStakesPermitted with Correct Boolean Value

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-vvv-vesting-staking/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/staking/VVVETHStaking.sol#L273-L276
## Summary
The setNewStakesPermitted function allows an admin to update the newStakesPermitted boolean value. However, there is a vulnerability that can lead to incorrect updates, potentially affecting the behavior of the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability arises from the following aspects of the function which doesn't check if new value is the same as previous value
```solidity
   ///@notice sets newStakesPermitted
    function setNewStakesPermitted(bool _newStakesPermitted) external onlyAuthorized {
        newStakesPermitted = _newStakesPermitted;
    }
```

Lack of Validation:
The function does not validate whether the provided _newStakesPermitted value is accurate (i.e., true or false).
Admins can inadvertently set previously set boolean repeatedly.

For example if newStakesPermitted was previously set to false and an admin intends to set the method to true, because the function doesn't crosscheck if new bool is as previously set.  _newStakesPermitted can still remain false and user are unable to go on with their stakes unknown to the admin.
Also if the protocol is under some kind of malicious attack, and the admin intends to stop stake temporarily, because of an error that might arise from setting new values, the attack isn't curbed as intended.
## Impact
Protocol Behavior: Incorrectly setting newStakesPermitted can affect the protocolâ€™s behavior related to setting new stakes.
User Experience: Users may encounter unexpected behavior due to incorrect boolean values.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
   ///@notice sets newStakesPermitted
    function setNewStakesPermitted(bool _newStakesPermitted) external onlyAuthorized {
        newStakesPermitted = _newStakesPermitted;
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add require statement that checks if  newStakesPermitted is not as previously set
```solidity
   ///@notice sets newStakesPermitted
    function setNewStakesPermitted(bool _newStakesPermitted) external onlyAuthorized {
        require(_newStakesPermitted == newStakesPermitted, "incorrect bool alue"  )
        newStakesPermitted = _newStakesPermitted;
    }
```
