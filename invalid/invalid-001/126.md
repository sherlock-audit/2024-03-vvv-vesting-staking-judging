# ETH to VVV rate wrongly hardcoded to 1.

## Summary
Wrong hardcoded value

## Vulnerability Detail
When calculating the user accrued vvv, it is based on the ETH to VVV rate. 

If we look at the rate, we'll se it is wrongly hardcoded to 1.

```solidity
    ///@notice Returns the exchange rate of ETH to $VVV for staking reward accrual
    function ethToVvvExchangeRate() public pure returns (uint256) {
        return 1;
    }
```

Based on this all VVV accrued will be minted 1:1. 

## Impact
Wrong amount of VVV minted
