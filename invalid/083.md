# Potential Manipulation of User Staking Rewards in `VVVETHStaking` Contract

## Summary
The `setDurationMultipliers` function in the `VVVETHStaking` contract allows for the modification of stake duration multipliers without proper limit verification. This can result in rewards for existing stakes being calculated based on new multipliers set by authorized users, rather than the expected values at the time of staking, enabling the manipulation of user rewards and impacting the system's fairness and integrity.

## Vulnerability Detail
Authorized users can call the `setDurationMultipliers` function to modify the stake duration multipliers without adequate checks on the values. As a result, users who have staked funds for a specific duration may receive different rewards than expected, as the contract calculates rewards based on the multipliers associated with the staking duration at the time of calculation. This allows authorized users to manipulate rewards at any time, affecting the rewards of existing stakes.

## Impact
The vulnerability poses a significant risk, as it can lead to unfair reward distribution and manipulation of the staking system. Users who have staked funds may receive rewards that do not correspond to the initial terms, potentially leading to a loss of trust in the staking contract and dissatisfaction among users.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this issue, consider storing the actual multiplier in the `StakeData` structure as an attribute to reflect the multiplier associated with the staking duration for each user stake. Modify the reward calculation logic to use this stored multiplier instead of directly accessing the `durationToMultiplier` mapping. This approach ensures that changes to the multipliers in the `durationToMultiplier` mapping only affect new stakes and do not impact the rewards of existing stakes.
