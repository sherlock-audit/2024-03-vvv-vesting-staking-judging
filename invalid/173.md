# DoS via Fallback Function

## Summary
The`VVVETHStaking` contract's fallback function allows it to receive ETH without updating any state. This could lead to a scenario where the contract holds ETH that is not accounted for in any user's stake. 
This could result in funds being locked in the contract with no way to retrieve them through the contract's logic.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
///@notice Fallback function to receive ETH
receive() external payable {
    emit EtherReceived();
}
```
- this function emits an `EtherReceived` event but does not update any state related to user stakes. 
- As a result, if someone sends ETH directly to the contract without calling `stakeEth`, that ETH would not be associated with any stake and would not be claimable or withdrawable through the contract's staking mechanism.

- To prevent ETH from being sent to the contract without creating a corresponding stake, the receive function could be modified to revert, ensuring all ETH sent to the contract is accounted for properly:
```solidity
 ///@notice Fallback function to prevent receiving ETH not associated with a stake
receive() external payable {
    revert("Direct ETH transfers not allowed");
}
```
This change would prevent the contract from accepting ETH that isn't associated with a new stake, thus avoiding the scenario where ETH is locked in the contract without a corresponding stake record.

## Impact
-  result in funds being locked in the contract with no way to retrieve them through the contract's logic

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Modify the fallback function to revert, ensuring that all ETH sent to the contract is accounted for properly.
```solidity
 ///@notice Fallback function to prevent receiving ETH not associated with a stake
receive() external payable {
    revert("Direct ETH transfers not allowed");
}
```
