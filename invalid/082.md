# Insufficient Assurance of `$VVV` Tokens in `VVVETHStaking` Contract

## Summary
The `claimVvv` function in the `VVVETHStaking` contract allows users to claim `$VVV` tokens. However, there is uncertainty about whether the contract will contain all the tokens needed for rewards due to the dynamic nature of rewards calculation based on staked amounts and durations.

## Vulnerability Detail
Upon deployment, the `VVVToken` contract mints `_initialSupply` tokens to the deployer address. The mint function in `VVVToken` has access control, and the rewards logic in `VVVETHStaking` contract depends on the admin minting the rewards needed for the contract. There is a concern that the contract may not have enough tokens to fulfill all rewards, leading to an inability to fulfill reward claims if the contract runs out of tokens.

## Impact
The uncertainty surrounding token availability can result in users being unable to claim their `$VVV` rewards, potentially leading to a loss of trust in the staking contract and dissatisfaction among users.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding a mint role to the `VVVETHStaking` contract that allows the contract to mint tokens as needed for rewards. Modify the `claimVvv` function to `mint` rewards to users instead of using the `safeTransfer` function. This ensures that the contract always has enough tokens to fulfill reward claims.
