# Incorrect values set for duration multipliers

## Summary

The values of duration multipliers are set within the constructor in a non-linear fashion, which leads to a scenario where it is much more profitable to stake for 3 months duration rather than 6 or 12 months.

## Vulnerability Detail

The values of duration multipliers within the constructor are set to the following values:

```solidity
durationToMultiplier[StakingDuration.ThreeMonths] = 10_000;
durationToMultiplier[StakingDuration.SixMonths] = 15_000;
durationToMultiplier[StakingDuration.OneYear] = 30_000;
```

Taking into account calculation in [`calculateAccruedVvvAmount`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-vvv-vesting-staking/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/staking/VVVETHStaking.sol#L236-L238):

```solidity
 accruedVvv =
  (nominalAccruedEth * ethToVvvExchangeRate() * durationToMultiplier[_stake.stakeDuration]) /
   DENOMINATOR;
```

It leads to scenario that using three months staking duration user can claim significantly more rewards than using six months and one year in comparison `4:3`.


**Staking 4 x 3 months**
`4` * `1e18 * 1 * 10_000 / 10_000` => `4e18`

**Staking 2 x 6 months**
`2` * `1e18 * 1 * 15_000 / 10_000` => `3e18`

**Staking 12 months**
`1` * `1e18 * 1 * 30_000 / 10_000` => `3e18`

## Impact

The user is significantly incentivized to stake funds for 3 months and not 6 or 12 months.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to update duration multipliers to the values:
```solidity
durationToMultiplier[StakingDuration.ThreeMonths] = 10_000;
durationToMultiplier[StakingDuration.SixMonths] = 20_000;
durationToMultiplier[StakingDuration.OneYear] = 40_000;
```
