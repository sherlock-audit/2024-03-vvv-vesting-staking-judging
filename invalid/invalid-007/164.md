# Users who stake three months many times will get more VVV tokens than users who stake six months or one year during the same period of time

## Summary
Users who stake three months many times will get more VVV tokens than users who stake six months or one year during the same period of time
## Vulnerability Detail
```ethToVvvExchangeRate``` is currently set to 1.```durationToMultiplier``` is set as follows:
```solidity
constructor(
    address _authorizationRegistryAddress
) VVVAuthorizationRegistryChecker(_authorizationRegistryAddress) {
    durationToSeconds[StakingDuration.ThreeMonths] = 90 days;
    durationToSeconds[StakingDuration.SixMonths] = 180 days;
    durationToSeconds[StakingDuration.OneYear] = 360 days;

    durationToMultiplier[StakingDuration.ThreeMonths] = 10_000;
@>    durationToMultiplier[StakingDuration.SixMonths] = 15_000;
@>    durationToMultiplier[StakingDuration.OneYear] = 30_000;
}
```
A user stakes 1 ETH for 3 months and receive 1 $VVV Token after 3 months.
Repeating the above operation twice, the user receives a total of 2 $VVV Tokens.
Repeating the above operation four times, the user receives a total of 4 $VVV Tokens.
Compared to staking 1 ETH for 6 months or 12 months, the above operation can obtain more $VVV Tokens:
* 0.5 more $VVV Tokens than staking for 6 months directly
* 1 more $VVV Token than staking for 12 months directly

So users who stake for a long duration one time may receive fewer tokens.
## Impact
Users who stake for a long duration one time may receive fewer tokens. It incentivizes users to stake for shorter periods.
## POC
Add this in ```VVVETHStaking.unit.t.sol```:
```solidity
import {console} from "lib/forge-std/src/console.sol";
```
```solidity
function testLongerStakeOneTimeAndShorterStakeSeveralTime() public {
        address userA = makeAddr("userA");
        address userB = makeAddr("userB");

        vm.deal(userA, 1 ether);
        vm.deal(userB, 1 ether);
        // userA stake 1 ether one year
        vm.startPrank(userA);
        EthStakingInstance.stakeEth{value: 1 ether}(VVVETHStaking.StakingDuration.OneYear);
        advanceBlockNumberAndTimestampInSeconds(
            EthStakingInstance.durationToSeconds(VVVETHStaking.StakingDuration.OneYear) + 1
        );
        uint256 AclaimableVvv = EthStakingInstance.calculateClaimableVvvAmount();
        vm.stopPrank();
        // userB stake 1 ether threeMonths, and restake 1 ether thereeMonths again and again till one year
        vm.startPrank(userB);
        EthStakingInstance.stakeEth{value: 1 ether}(VVVETHStaking.StakingDuration.ThreeMonths);
        advanceBlockNumberAndTimestampInSeconds(
            EthStakingInstance.durationToSeconds(VVVETHStaking.StakingDuration.ThreeMonths) + 1
        );
        EthStakingInstance.restakeEth(2, VVVETHStaking.StakingDuration.ThreeMonths);
        advanceBlockNumberAndTimestampInSeconds(
            EthStakingInstance.durationToSeconds(VVVETHStaking.StakingDuration.ThreeMonths) + 1
        );
        EthStakingInstance.restakeEth(3, VVVETHStaking.StakingDuration.ThreeMonths);
        advanceBlockNumberAndTimestampInSeconds(
            EthStakingInstance.durationToSeconds(VVVETHStaking.StakingDuration.ThreeMonths) + 1
        );
        EthStakingInstance.restakeEth(4, VVVETHStaking.StakingDuration.ThreeMonths);
        advanceBlockNumberAndTimestampInSeconds(
            EthStakingInstance.durationToSeconds(VVVETHStaking.StakingDuration.ThreeMonths) + 1
        );
        uint256 BclaimableVvv = EthStakingInstance.calculateClaimableVvvAmount();
        vm.stopPrank();
        console.log("The amount of VVV tokens A get:", AclaimableVvv);
        console.log("The amount of VVV tokens B get:", BclaimableVvv);
    }
```
The results are as follows:
