# The attacker has a way to claim more VvvToken

## Summary
Due to the incorrect initialization of durationToMultiplier, an attacker can pledge the same ETH for three months first, and then pledge it for three months, and obtain more VvvTokens than directly staking for six months.

## Vulnerability Detail
Since it is set during initialization:
```solidity
    durationToMultiplier[StakingDuration.ThreeMonths] = 10_000;
    durationToMultiplier[StakingDuration.SixMonths] = 15_000;
```
An attacker can pledge the same ETH for three months first and then for three months to obtain more VvvTokens than if he pledged it directly for six months.

## Impact
The attacker has a way to claim more VvvToken.

```solidity
            nominalAccruedEth = (secondsStaked * _stake.stakedEthAmount) / stakeDuration;

            accruedVvv =
                (nominalAccruedEth * ethToVvvExchangeRate() * durationToMultiplier[_stake.stakeDuration]) /
                DENOMINATOR;
        }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to set a reasonable value for durationToMultiplier[StakingDuration.ThreeMonths] during initialization.
