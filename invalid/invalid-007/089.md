# The value of durationToMultiplier is not proportional to time

The value of durationToMultiplier is not proportional to time

## Summary

The value of durationToMultiplier is not proportional to time

## Vulnerability Detail

durationToMultiplier is uesd to calculate the amount of $VVV that user can accrued. The longer the staking time is, the more VVV will be accrued. However, in the contract, the design of durationToMultiplier will make users more inclined to stake  for three months rather than longer. 

```solidity
durationToMultiplier[StakingDuration.ThreeMonths] = 10_000;
durationToMultiplier[StakingDuration.SixMonths] = 15_000;
durationToMultiplier[StakingDuration.OneYear] = 30_000;
```

For example, when a user wants to stake for six months, he/she will split it into two three months because this will bring more benefits (2*10000 > 15000).

## Impact

The benefits of staking are disproportionate to time, and users will tend to stake for three months rather than longer.

## Recommendation

Change the values of durationToMultiplier to keep its proportions.

```solidity
durationToMultiplier[StakingDuration.ThreeMonths] = 10_000;
durationToMultiplier[StakingDuration.SixMonths] = 20_000;
durationToMultiplier[StakingDuration.OneYear] = 40_000;
```
