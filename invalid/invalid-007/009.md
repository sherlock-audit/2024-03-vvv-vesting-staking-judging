# The parameters of `durationToSeconds` and `durationToMultiplier` initialization settings in `VVVETHStaking::constructor()` are incorrect

## Summary
The parameters of `durationToSeconds` and `durationToMultiplier` initialization settings in `VVVETHStaking::constructor()` are incorrect. It will result in users staking within short periods.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the context, the longer the staking period, the higher the rewards.Staking for 6 months should yield more rewards than staking twice for 3 months each. 
However in constructor, Multiplier for 6 months is 1.5, besides multiplier for 3 months is 1.
```javascript
constructor(
        address _authorizationRegistryAddress
    ) VVVAuthorizationRegistryChecker(_authorizationRegistryAddress) {
        durationToSeconds[StakingDuration.ThreeMonths] = 90 days;
        durationToSeconds[StakingDuration.SixMonths] = 180 days;
        durationToSeconds[StakingDuration.OneYear] = 360 days;

        durationToMultiplier[StakingDuration.ThreeMonths] = 10_000;
        durationToMultiplier[StakingDuration.SixMonths] = 15_000;
        durationToMultiplier[StakingDuration.OneYear] = 30_000;
    }

```
**POC**
1. Calculating award for stake three months two times using 1 eth
2. Calculating award for stake six months two times using 1 eth
3. Comparing the result for total awards
```javascript
function testCalculateAccruedVvvAmountComparingDifferentStakingPeriods() public {
        //mork stake 3 months
        VVVETHStaking.StakeData memory stake_first_3_month = VVVETHStaking.StakeData({
            stakedEthAmount: uint224(1 ether),
            stakeStartTimestamp: uint32(block.timestamp),
            stakeIsWithdrawn: false,
            stakeDuration: VVVETHStaking.StakingDuration.ThreeMonths
        });

        //mork stake 6 months
         VVVETHStaking.StakeData memory stake_6_month = VVVETHStaking.StakeData({
            stakedEthAmount: uint224(1 ether),
            stakeStartTimestamp: uint32(block.timestamp),
            stakeIsWithdrawn: false,
            stakeDuration: VVVETHStaking.StakingDuration.SixMonths
        });

        //3 months pass,  forward staking duration + 1
        advanceBlockNumberAndTimestampInSeconds(
            EthStakingInstance.durationToSeconds(VVVETHStaking.StakingDuration.ThreeMonths) + 1
        );

        uint256 accruedVvv_first_3_month = EthStakingInstance.calculateAccruedVvvAmount(stake_first_3_month);
        //mork stake another 3 months
        VVVETHStaking.StakeData memory stake_second_3_month = VVVETHStaking.StakeData({
            stakedEthAmount: uint224(1 ether),
            stakeStartTimestamp: uint32(block.timestamp),
            stakeIsWithdrawn: false,
            stakeDuration: VVVETHStaking.StakingDuration.ThreeMonths
        });

        //another 3 months pass,  forward staking duration + 1
        advanceBlockNumberAndTimestampInSeconds(
            EthStakingInstance.durationToSeconds(VVVETHStaking.StakingDuration.ThreeMonths) + 1
        );

        uint256 accruedVvv_second_3_month = EthStakingInstance.calculateAccruedVvvAmount(stake_second_3_month);
        uint256 accruedVvv_6_month = EthStakingInstance.calculateAccruedVvvAmount(stake_6_month);
        console2.log("Award for stake three months two times is: ", accruedVvv_first_3_month + accruedVvv_second_3_month);
        console2.log("Award for stake six months one times is: ", accruedVvv_6_month);
        assertTrue(accruedVvv_6_month>=accruedVvv_first_3_month + accruedVvv_second_3_month);
    }

```
add this test function in `VVVETHStaking.unit.t.sol`,then run:
forge test --mt testCalculateAccruedVvvAmountComparingDifferentStakingPeriods -vv
will get:
```javascript
[FAIL. Reason: assertion failed] testCalculateAccruedVvvAmountComparingDifferentStakingPeriods() (gas: 83878)
Logs:

## Impact
Medium, It will result in users staking within short periods.This wasn't the intended purpose of the protocol design.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Modify the multiplier for  the options for staking duration
