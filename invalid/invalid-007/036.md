# Initially `durationToMultiplier` was not implemented correctly, so users prefer to stake only for the shortest `StakingDuration` (`StakingDuration.ThreeMonths`).

## Summary
User can claim $VVV token based on `stakedEthAmount` and  `durationToMultiplier` for StakingDuration type.
The protocol initially has three types of `StackingDuration`, but if user's `StakingDuration` is not `StakingDuration.ThreeMonths`, then `durationToMultiplier` is meaningless to users due to lower accruing.
So users prefer to stake only for the shortest `StakingDuration.ThreeMonths`, other StakingDuration might not be used. 

## Vulnerability Detail
accrued vvv amount is calculated based on the following function.
```solidity
function calculateAccruedVvvAmount(StakeData memory _stake) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 stakeDuration = durationToSeconds[_stake.stakeDuration];
        uint256 secondsSinceStakingStarted = block.timestamp - _stake.stakeStartTimestamp;
        uint256 secondsStaked;
        uint256 nominalAccruedEth;
        uint256 accruedVvv;

        unchecked {
            secondsStaked = secondsSinceStakingStarted >= stakeDuration
                ? stakeDuration
                : secondsSinceStakingStarted;

            nominalAccruedEth = (secondsStaked * _stake.stakedEthAmount) / stakeDuration;

@>          accruedVvv =
                (nominalAccruedEth * ethToVvvExchangeRate() * durationToMultiplier[_stake.stakeDuration]) /
                DENOMINATOR;
        }

        return accruedVvv;
    }
```
As we can see above code snippet, `accruedVvv` reaches `stakedEthAmount` * `durationToMultiplier` after its `StakingDuration`.
Initial `StakingDuration`, and `duratinoToMultiplier` are in the constructor:

```solidity
constructor(
        address _authorizationRegistryAddress
    ) VVVAuthorizationRegistryChecker(_authorizationRegistryAddress) { // @audit durationMultiplier is not exact
        durationToSeconds[StakingDuration.ThreeMonths] = 90 days;
        durationToSeconds[StakingDuration.SixMonths] = 180 days;
        durationToSeconds[StakingDuration.OneYear] = 360 days;

        durationToMultiplier[StakingDuration.ThreeMonths] = 10_000;
        durationToMultiplier[StakingDuration.SixMonths] = 15_000;
        durationToMultiplier[StakingDuration.OneYear] = 30_000;
    }
``` 
Indeed, SixMonths = 2 * ThreeMonths, OneYear = 4 * ThreeMonths, but  
```solidity
durationToMultiplier[StakingDuration.SixMonths] < 2 * durationToMultiplier[StakingDuration.ThreeMonths]
durationToMultiplier[StakingDuration.OneYear] < 4 * durationToMultiplier[StakingDuration.ThreeMonths] 
```
Therefore, user can claim stakedEthAmount(currently, ethToVvvExchangeRate()  = 1)  after ThreeMonths, and then reclaim exact amount again after more ThreeMonths by restaking.
So user can claim 2 * `stakedEthAmount` after Six months by staking and then restaking for `StakingDuration.ThreeMonths`. 
But user can only accrued 1.5 * `stakedEthAmount` for `StakingDuration.SixMonths`.
It makes long staking less profitable for staked user.

## Impact
Anyone who estimates profit rate per `StakingDuration` does not stake long `StakingDuration`, but only stake `StakingDuration.ThreeMonths`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
set `durationToMultiplier[StakingDuration.SixMonths]` to at least 2 times of `durationToMultiplier[StakingDuration.ThreeMonths]`, `durationToMultiplier[StakingDuration.OneYear]` as more than 4 times of `durationToMultiplier[StakingDuration.ThreeMonths]` and more than 2 times of `durationToMultiplier[StakingDuration.SixMonths]`.
