# Loss of VVV tokens for users who staked ETH for 6 months and 1 year while claiming VVV tokens using claimVvv()

## Summary
Users who staked ETH for time duration of `SixMonths` and `OneYear` would get less number of VVV tokens while claiming through `claimVvv()` due to incorrect `durationToMultiplier` .

## Vulnerability Detail

- There are 3 time period for which users can stake their ETH 
  - ThreeMonths(90 days) where durationToMultiplier is 10000
  - SixMonths(180 days) where durationToMultiplier is 15000
  - OneYear(360 days) where durationToMultiplier is 30000
- Let's assume 
  - UserA stakes 1 ETH for 3 months.
  - UserB stakes 1 ETH for 6 months.
  - UserC stakes 1 ETH for 1 year. 
   
- When 3 months get's over UserA would be able to claim 1e18 VVV tokens . Now UserA restake the ETH through `restakeEth()` for another 3 months.
- When another 3 months duration(Total 6 months) get's over at that time` UserA` would be able to claim `2e18` VVV Tokens ( 1e18 for 3 months + 1e18 for another 3 months). So after claiming UserA would have 2e18 VVV tokens.
- As 6 month's duration has been over so `UserB` also can claim VVV tokens , when UserB claims his tokens he would be able to claim `1.5e18` VVV tokens 
- Comparing UserA and UserB for 6 months duration , `UserA` would be able to claim `2e18` VVV tokens while `UserB` would be able to claim only `1.5e18`.
- Hence `UserB` suffers a `loss` of `0.5e18` VVV tokens even though the staking duration is same that is `6 months`.
- Same can be replicated for 1 year as well.
- Ex - UserA does stake and restake such that the the staking duration becomes 1 year . When duration of 1 year completes UserA would be able to claim  4e18 VVV Tokens( 1e18 + 1e18 + 1e18 + 1e18) in comparison UserC would be only able to claim 3e18 VVV Tokens.
- Thus making a `loss` of `1e18` VVV tokens loss for `UserC`.
- For further clarity see POC.  
## POC
- Add this test inside VVVETHStakingUnitTests and run the test.
```solidity
function testStakeThreeMonths() public {

        // UserA
        vm.startPrank(sampleUser, sampleUser);
        // 1 ETH staked
        uint256 stakeEthAmount = 1 ether;

        // 1ETH staking for 3 months
        uint256 stakeId = EthStakingInstance.stakeEth{ value: stakeEthAmount }(
            VVVETHStaking.StakingDuration.ThreeMonths
        );

        // forward to first timestamp with released stake
        advanceBlockNumberAndTimestampInSeconds(
            EthStakingInstance.durationToSeconds(VVVETHStaking.StakingDuration.ThreeMonths) + 1
        );

        // restaking 1 ETH for another 3 months 
        VVVETHStaking.StakingDuration restakeDuration = VVVETHStaking.StakingDuration.ThreeMonths;
        uint256 restakeId1 = EthStakingInstance.restakeEth(stakeId, restakeDuration);

        // forward to first timestamp with released stake
        advanceBlockNumberAndTimestampInSeconds(
            EthStakingInstance.durationToSeconds(VVVETHStaking.StakingDuration.ThreeMonths) + 1
        );
        
        // Checking total claimable VVV token after staking ETH for 6 months
        uint256 claimableVvv = EthStakingInstance.calculateClaimableVvvAmount();
        console.log("The total claimable balance after staking ETH for 3 months and again restaking for another 3 months is",claimableVvv);

        uint256 vvvBalanceBefore = VvvTokenInstance.balanceOf(sampleUser);

        // claiming VVV tokens
        EthStakingInstance.claimVvv(claimableVvv);
        uint256 vvvBalanceAfter = VvvTokenInstance.balanceOf(sampleUser);
        console.log("User's balance of VVV Token after claiming ",vvvBalanceAfter);

        

        vm.stopPrank();

        
    }
    function testStakeforSixmonth() public {

        // UserB who stakes 1 ETH in one go for 6 months
        vm.startPrank(sampleUser, sampleUser);
        uint256 stakeEthAmount = 1 ether;
        EthStakingInstance.stakeEth{ value: stakeEthAmount }(VVVETHStaking.StakingDuration.SixMonths);

        // forward to first timestamp with released stake
        advanceBlockNumberAndTimestampInSeconds(
            EthStakingInstance.durationToSeconds(VVVETHStaking.StakingDuration.OneYear) + 1
        );
        
        //  Checking total claimable VVV token after staking ETH for 6 months
        uint256 claimableVvv = EthStakingInstance.calculateClaimableVvvAmount();
        console.log("The total claimable balance after staking ETH for 6 months is",claimableVvv);

        uint256 vvvBalanceBefore = VvvTokenInstance.balanceOf(sampleUser);

        EthStakingInstance.claimVvv(claimableVvv);
        uint256 vvvBalanceAfter = VvvTokenInstance.balanceOf(sampleUser);
        console.log("User's balance of VVV Token after claiming",vvvBalanceAfter);
        console.log("As we can see from above function's console that User")

        
        vm.stopPrank();
        }
```

## Impact
- Users who staked Eth for 6 months and 1 year would be able to claim less number of VVV tokens compared to user who staked multiple times using 3 month duration due to incorrect durationToMultiplier.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Change durationToMultiplier such that ratio remains same across different time durations.
  - set ThreeMonths(90 days) durationToMultiplier to 10000
  - set SixMonths(180 days)  durationToMultiplier to 20000
  - set OneYear(360 days)  durationToMultiplier is 40000

- If you don't want to change durationToMultiplier then simply increase staking period of three months (90 days) to four months (120 days) where ratio would  be maintained.
