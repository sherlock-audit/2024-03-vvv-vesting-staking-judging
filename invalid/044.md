# The `eth/vvv` exchange rate cannot be set to a fraction of a unit

## Summary

The `ETH/vVv` exchange rate is a key component of calculating the accrued `$VVV` based on a user's ETH staking within the contract `VVVETHStaking`. Initially, it is set at 1, meaning for each ETH staked, the user will receive 1 `VVV` token.

The issue is that this exchange rate can be set to a value more than 1, but it cannot be set to a fraction of a unit (e.g., `1/2`). This will greatly limit the ability of the protocol team to set an exchange rate adequate to the circumstances. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The `ETH/vVv` exchange rate is defined by the function `ethToVvvExchangeRate`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-vvv-vesting-staking/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/staking/VVVETHStaking.sol#L253-L256
```solidity
///@notice Returns the exchange rate of ETH to $VVV for staking reward accrual
function ethToVvvExchangeRate() public pure returns (uint256) {
    return 1;
}
```

And this function is used within the `calculateAccruedVvvAmount` function:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-vvv-vesting-staking/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/staking/VVVETHStaking.sol#L237
```solidity
    function calculateAccruedVvvAmount(StakeData memory _stake) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 stakeDuration = durationToSeconds[_stake.stakeDuration];
        uint256 secondsSinceStakingStarted = block.timestamp - _stake.stakeStartTimestamp;
        uint256 secondsStaked;
        uint256 nominalAccruedEth;
        uint256 accruedVvv;

        unchecked {
            secondsStaked = secondsSinceStakingStarted >= stakeDuration
                ? stakeDuration
                : secondsSinceStakingStarted;

            nominalAccruedEth = (secondsStaked * _stake.stakedEthAmount) / stakeDuration;

            accruedVvv =
>>>             (nominalAccruedEth * ethToVvvExchangeRate() * durationToMultiplier[_stake.stakeDuration]) /
                DENOMINATOR;
        }

        return accruedVvv;
    }
```

The protocol documentation states that the value of the exchange rate will start at 1 but will likely change in the future. The main issue here is that this value can be increased but not decreased, meaning the minimum value is the current one (1).

If the protocol team wants to set the exchange rate to a value of 2, they can certainly do it, but if they want to set a value of `0.5`, it won't be possible because solidity doesn't have decimal places built into it. 

## Impact

The `ETH/vVv` exchange rate cannot be set to a value lower than one unit, for example `1/2`. This will greatly limit the ability of the protocol team to adapt the exchange rate to adequate circumstances, possibly leading to a disruption of the staking activity.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To mitigate this issue is recommended to set the initial value of the exchange rate to `1e18` and divide that value to `1e18` whenever using the exchange rate. This will allow the devs to set a value lower than one unit, for example, `0.5e18`. 

```diff
    function ethToVvvExchangeRate() public pure returns (uint256) {
-       return 1;
+       return 1e18;
    }
    
    function calculateAccruedVvvAmount(StakeData memory _stake) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 stakeDuration = durationToSeconds[_stake.stakeDuration];
        uint256 secondsSinceStakingStarted = block.timestamp - _stake.stakeStartTimestamp;
        uint256 secondsStaked;
        uint256 nominalAccruedEth;
        uint256 accruedVvv;

        unchecked {
            secondsStaked = secondsSinceStakingStarted >= stakeDuration
                ? stakeDuration
                : secondsSinceStakingStarted;

            nominalAccruedEth = (secondsStaked * _stake.stakedEthAmount) / stakeDuration;

            accruedVvv =
-                (nominalAccruedEth * ethToVvvExchangeRate() * durationToMultiplier[_stake.stakeDuration]) /
+                (nominalAccruedEth * ethToVvvExchangeRate() * durationToMultiplier[_stake.stakeDuration]) / 1e18 
                DENOMINATOR;
        }

        return accruedVvv;
    }
```
