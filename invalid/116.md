# Vesting schedules starting from 0 will be unclaimable

## Summary

If the admin creates a schedule where the start timestamp is `0`, with a proper cliff ending in the future, the user will be unable to withdraw


## Vulnerability Detail

The code uses timestamps of zero as a sentinel value, but there is nothing preventing the admin from using such a timestamp when creating the schedule.


## Impact

The schedule can be created, but the user will be unable to withdraw anything. If the admin has renounced the role, then the user's funds will be stuck forever.


## Code Snippet

There are [no checks](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-vvv-vesting-staking/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vesting/VVVVesting.sol#L191-L214) for a zero start timestamp, but that value causes the vested amount to always be zero, regardless of other values in the struct:
```solidity
// File: contracts/vesting/VVVVesting.sol : VVVVesting.getVestedAmount()   #1
232            if (
233                block.timestamp < vestingSchedule.scheduleStartTime ||
234 @>             vestingSchedule.scheduleStartTime == 0 ||
235                userVestingSchedules[_vestedUser].length == 0
236            ) {
237:               return 0;
```

## Recommendation

Disallow a [`_vestingScheduleStartTime`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-vvv-vesting-staking/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vesting/VVVVesting.sol#L323) of zero
