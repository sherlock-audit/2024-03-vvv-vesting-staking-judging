# setDurationMultipliers() doesn't check parameters have equal indexes

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-vvv-vesting-staking/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/staking/VVVETHStaking.sol#L272-L282
## Summary
setDurationMultipliers() doesn't check if both parameters are have equal indexes and as such wrong multipliers can be set for a different duration.
## Vulnerability Detail
setDurationMultipliers() is used to set new Multipliers for the different duration of a stake. This multiplier is a constant that is utilied in calculating the accrued VvV tokens for a user. 
            accruedVvv =
                (nominalAccruedEth * ethToVvvExchangeRate() * durationToMultiplier[_stake.stakeDuration]) /
                DENOMINATOR;
The function however doesn't check if both arrays in the input parameters have equal indexes and as such wrong inputs can be set. 
## Impact
Wrong multipliers can be set for a different time duration, thereby producing wrong tokens accrued for users

## Code Snippet
```solidty
  /**
        @notice Returns the total amount of $VVV accrued by a single stake
        @dev considers the "nominalAccruedEth" and multiplies by the exchange rate and duration multiplier to obtain the total $VVV accrued
        @param _stake A StakeData struct representing the stake for which the accrued $VVV is to be calculated
        @return $VVV accrued
     */
    function calculateAccruedVvvAmount(StakeData memory _stake) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 stakeDuration = durationToSeconds[_stake.stakeDuration];
        uint256 secondsSinceStakingStarted = block.timestamp - _stake.stakeStartTimestamp;
        uint256 secondsStaked;
        uint256 nominalAccruedEth;
        uint256 accruedVvv;

        unchecked {
            secondsStaked = secondsSinceStakingStarted >= stakeDuration
                ? stakeDuration
                : secondsSinceStakingStarted;

            nominalAccruedEth = (secondsStaked * _stake.stakedEthAmount) / stakeDuration;

            accruedVvv =
                (nominalAccruedEth * ethToVvvExchangeRate() * durationToMultiplier[_stake.stakeDuration]) /
                DENOMINATOR;
        }

        return accruedVvv;
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
function should check if length of array of both duration input and multipliers inputs are equal.
```solidity
 function setDurationMultipliers(
        StakingDuration[] memory _duration,
        uint256[] memory _multipliers
    ) external onlyAuthorized {
       require(_duration.length == _multipliers.length, "duration index and multipiers index not equal  )
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _duration.length; ++i) {
            durationToMultiplier[_duration[i]] = _multipliers[i];
        }
    }
```
