# StakeData struct is missing a field for the accruedVvv

## Summary
The `StakeData` struct in the `VVVETHStaking` contract lacks a field to store the accrued VVV tokens for each stake.
## Vulnerability Detail
The StakeData struct is used to store information related to each stake, including the staked ETH amount, stake start timestamp, stake duration, and whether the stake has been withdrawn. However, it does not include a field to store the accrued VVV tokens for the stake.

## Impact
This  could lead to inaccurate tracking of accrued rewards and potentially impact the reliability of reward calculations

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a new field to the StakeData struct to store the accrued VVV tokens for each stake
struct StakeData {
    uint224 stakedEthAmount;
    uint32 stakeStartTimestamp;
    bool stakeIsWithdrawn;
    StakingDuration stakeDuration;
    uint256 accruedVvv; // New field to store accrued VVV tokens
}
