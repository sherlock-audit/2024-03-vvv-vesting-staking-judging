# Missing Access Control Check

## Summary


The `setVestingSchedule` function lacks validation to check if the `_vestedUser` exists before setting the vesting schedule. This omission could potentially allow an attacker to create a vesting schedule for a non-existent user.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `setVestingSchedule` function allows the setting of a vesting schedule for a specified user without verifying the existence of the user beforehand. This oversight means that an attacker could exploit the function to create a vesting schedule for an address that does not correspond to any legitimate user.

## Impact
This could result in unexpected behavior, misuse of the vesting contract, or potential loss of assets.

## Recommendation
Implement a validation check to ensure the existence of the `_vestedUser` address before setting the vesting schedule.
