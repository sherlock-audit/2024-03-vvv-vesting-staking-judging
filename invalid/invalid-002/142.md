# Potential DoS in Vesting

## Summary
This error is the same as I described in the [previous issue](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-vvv-vesting-staking-BengalCatBalu/issues/1), only now it occurs in the Vesting contract.
The essence of the error is the same, the contract calculates the number of tokens the user can withdraw based on information from VestingSchedule (the most important factor that can be changed is growthRateProportion), which can be updated by the developer before all tokens are withdrawn. However, the _vestingScheduleAmountWithdrawn field stores information about the number of tokens that were deduced with the old values. Because of this. 
 the [getVestedAmount(msg.sender, _vestingScheduleIndex) - vestingSchedule.tokenAmountWithdrawn](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-vvv-vesting-staking/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vesting/VVVVesting.sol#L158-L158) line may have an underflow that results in a transaction revert.

## Vulnerability Detail
Example, let's say at the beginning of vesting r = growthRateProportion = 4. a = tokensToVestAfterFirstInterva = 1. Let's consider the case where the user wanted to withdraw first after 4 passed intervals and then after n = 6. If in the interval between n = 4 and n = 6 intervals the developers decide to reduce growthRateProportion to 2, dos will occur. getVestedAmount() calculates the number of tokens using the formula Sn = a * (r^n - 1) / (r - 1).

When the user outputs for the first time, it will output 1 * (4 ^ 4 - 1)/ (4 - 1) = 85 tokens. His tokenAmountWithdrawn value will become 85. When he wants to output after the 6th interval, if r decreases to 2, getVestedAmount() = 1 * (2 ^ 6 - 1)/ (2 - 1) = 63. And the user won't be able to withdraw tokens until enough periods have passed to cover the difference, because trying 63 - 85 will cause a revert

## Impact

Logically this bug is similar to the previous one, but due to the fact that each user is configured with a different VestingSchedule, unlike the previous contract where the steering conditions are common for all, it is unlikely that this vulnerability will affect a large number of users, but developers should be aware of its possibility, because if they want to worsen the vesting conditions for a particular user, it can lead to a DoS for that user.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In the VestingSchedule struct, you can create a list that will store the growthRateProportion for each interval
