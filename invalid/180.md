# `VVVETHStaking::setDurationMultipliers` Inconsistent Array Lengths which leads to reverts or ignored inputs.

## Summary
`setDurationMultipliers` function in the VVVETHStaking contract does not validate that the lengths of the _duration and _multipliers arrays are equal, potentially leading to reverts or ignored inputs.

## Vulnerability Detail
- The function accepts two arrays, _duration and _multipliers, without checking if their lengths match.
- If _multipliers is shorter, accessing an index that exists in _duration but not in _multipliers will cause a revert.
- If _multipliers is longer, the surplus values will be ignored, potentially leading to misconfiguration.

```solidity
function setDurationMultipliers(
        StakingDuration[] memory _duration,
        uint256[] memory _multipliers
    ) external onlyAuthorized {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _duration.length; ++i) {
            durationToMultiplier[_duration[i]] = _multipliers[i];
        }
    }
```


## Impact
Risk of incorrect multiplier configuration, affecting staking rewards.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use a require statement to revert the transaction with a clear error message if the lengths do not match.

```solidity
require(_duration.length == _multipliers.length, "Array lengths must match");

```
