# The vvv tokens user claim from staking contract may be different from the one at the time they initially staked

## Summary

The vvv tokens user claim from staking contract may be different from the one at the time they initially staked

## Vulnerability Detail

In the VVVETHStaking contract, users staking ETH expect to receive vvv1 tokens as their reward. However, during the staking period, an admin can change the reward to vvv2 tokens. Consequently, users would only be able to claim VVV2 tokens upon withdrawal, differing from their initial expectations.

```solidity
    function claimVvv(uint256 _vvvAmount) external {
        if (_vvvAmount == 0) revert CantClaimZeroVvv();

        uint256 claimableVvv = calculateClaimableVvvAmount();
        if (_vvvAmount > claimableVvv) revert InsufficientClaimableVvv();

        userVvvClaimed[msg.sender] += _vvvAmount;

>       vvvToken.safeTransfer(msg.sender, _vvvAmount);

        emit VvvClaim(msg.sender, _vvvAmount);
    }

    ...

    function setVvvToken(address _vvvTokenAddress) external onlyAuthorized {
>       vvvToken = IERC20(_vvvTokenAddress);
    }

```

## Impact

Users expecting to claim vvv1 token can only claim vvv2 token, which is not what they expect.

## Tool used

Manual review

## Recommendation

Also record the current vvv token in `userStakes`, and make sure the vvv token that is claimed is same as the one when the user initially stakes Eth. `userVvvClaimed` would also need to be modified.
