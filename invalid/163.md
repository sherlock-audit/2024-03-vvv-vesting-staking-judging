# Stakers cannot claim vvv tokens as rewards

## Summary

`VVVEthStaking::claimVvv()` functions so that stakers can claim `vvv` tokens as rewards, but this function will always fail if the `vvv` tokens available in `VVVEthStaking` run out and result in stakers not getting rewards from staking. This can happen because, in the `claimVvv` function, it only checks whether the amount to be claimed by the staker is `<=` of the claimable amount but does not check the balance available from the `vvv` token itself in the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

Let's jump to the test (coded POC) and I made it simple by setting the supply value of the minted `vvv` token at `VVVEthStaking.sol`= 1 and the user stakes 2 ETH.

In the `setUp(),` change :

```solidity
VvvTokenInstance.mint(address(EthStakingInstance), 1 * 1e18);
```

Run the test for staker claim `vvv` token :

```solidity
function testClaimVvvRevertBecauseNotEnoughVvv() public {
        vm.startPrank(sampleUser, sampleUser);
        uint256 stakeEthAmount = 2 ether;
        EthStakingInstance.stakeEth{ value: stakeEthAmount }(VVVETHStaking.StakingDuration.ThreeMonths);

        // forward to first timestamp with released stake
        advanceBlockNumberAndTimestampInSeconds(
            EthStakingInstance.durationToSeconds(VVVETHStaking.StakingDuration.ThreeMonths) + 1
        );

        uint256 claimableVvv = EthStakingInstance.calculateClaimableVvvAmount();

        uint256 vvvBalanceBefore = VvvTokenInstance.balanceOf(sampleUser);

        EthStakingInstance.claimVvv(claimableVvv);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

Result will fail because not enough `vvv` token in the contract :

```solidity
Running 1 test for test/staking/VVVETHStaking.unit.t.sol:VVVETHStakingUnitTests
[FAIL. Reason: ERC20InsufficientBalance(0xE82f6BD9565612CE7A960f5e0855BE68f9fEB58c, 1000000000000000000 [1e18], 2000000000000000000 [2e18])] testClaimVvvRevertBecauseNotEnoughVvv() (gas: 205141)

```

## Impact

Staker only stake their ETH for a long time (3 month, 6 month and 1 year) and got nothing.

## Tool used

Manual review

## Recommendation

1. Consider adding a `vvv` token reserve mechanism as a reward for users
2. add mapping `vvv` token balance in the contract (total supply - claimed `vvv`)
3. add check if user want to claim `vvv` token and make sure claim amount ≤ claimable `vvv` amount and ≤ balance of `vvv` token in contract
