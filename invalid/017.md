# Griefers able to call stake multiple times denying future stakers to stake tokens

## Summary
Participants have the option to deposit ether to receive VVV ERC20 tokens as rewards. Each deposit results in an increase in the stakeId counter, marking the unique stake events.

## Vulnerability Detail
During the staking process, the private function `_stakeEth` is invoked, incrementing the user's `stakeId`, which represents the latest stake event and is utilized for claiming VVV tokens. However, since there's no minimum required amount of ether for staking, malicious actors can exploit this by staking `1 wei` repeatedly, causing the `stakeId` to reach the maximum value defined by type(uint256).max. This flooding of the staking mechanism prevents future participants from staking or restaking within the protocol, triggering a Solidity revert due to overflow conditions.

```solidity
    function _stakeEth(StakingDuration _stakeDuration, uint256 _stakedEthAmount) private {
        if (_stakedEthAmount == 0) revert CantStakeZeroEth();
        ++stakeId; //@audit-issue able to grief id to max with 1 wei. And no one can stake again. Also causes users not able to restake

```

## Impact

The protocol experiences a critical issue where the stakeId reaches its maximum limit, rendering the protocol inoperable and leading to the loss of potential future stakers.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Instead of having a universal "stakeId" for all users, establish a mapping for each user and set a limit on the maximum stake that can be initiated.
