# Staker may lose their stake `ETH`
## Summary
Due to the downcasting issue in `_stakeEth` function, the amount of ETH `msg.value` is uint type, which will be forcibly converted to uint224 in the StakeData. This downcasting can potentially lead to stakers losing their ETH.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `stakeEth` function in "VVVETHStaking.sol" is used to call the `_stakeEth` function to perform staking with the stake amount being `msg.value`. However, `msg.value` is a "uint" type and while storing staking information in the "_stakeEth" function, a downcast occurs: `stakedEthAmount: uint224(_stakedEthAmount)`. As a result, when a staker deposits an amount of ETH that exceeds the uint224 limit, they may lose the deposited ETH.


### POC
```solidity
     function testStakeEth() public {
        vm.startPrank(sampleUser, sampleUser);
        uint256 stakeEthAmount = 1766847064778384329583297500742918515827483896875618958121606201292619776;

        uint256 stakeIdBefore = EthStakingInstance.stakeId();
        EthStakingInstance.stakeEth{ value: stakeEthAmount }(VVVETHStaking.StakingDuration.OneYear);


        uint256 stakeIdAfter = EthStakingInstance.stakeId();

        //get user's latest userStakeIds index
        uint256[] memory stakeIds = EthStakingInstance.userStakeIds(sampleUser);
        uint256 userStakeIdIndex = stakeIds.length - 1;

        (
            uint256 stakedEthAmount,
            uint256 stakedTimestamp,
            bool stakeIsWithdrawn,
            VVVETHStaking.StakingDuration stakedDuration
        ) = EthStakingInstance.userStakes(sampleUser, stakeIds[userStakeIdIndex]);

        assertTrue(stakedEthAmount == stakeEthAmount);
  
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

## Impact

When a staker deposits an amount exceeding the `uint224` limit, they stand to lose their ETH.

## Recommendation

To avoid the issues caused by downcasting, you should make sure that the data types used for value storage correspond to the actual types that can be handled without loss.
