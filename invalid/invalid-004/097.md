# Excess and Old vVv token will remain locked in Contract

## Summary

Currently there is no way for an admin to access the vVv tokens. This is a problems because any excess amount of vVv tokens will be locked in the contract permanently. This is also true for old vVv tokens when `setVvvToken` is called.

## Vulnerability Detail

The protocol is expected to supply vVv tokens to the `VVVETHStaking` contract to reward users for staking their ETH. The issue however is that with an unknown amount of users staking their funds it is improbable that the exact right amount of vVv tokens will be supplied to the contract.  Having too little vVv tokens supplied can lead to user being unable to claim their full amount due to insufficient funds. Meaning the practical solution will be to supply excess vVv tokens to ensure all users are able to be rewarded. The issue with that is that there is no way to recover these tokens.  

## Impact

Loss of reward token for protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To fix this all you have to do is add a rescue function that can only be accessed by the admin.
