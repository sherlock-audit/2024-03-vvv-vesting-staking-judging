# VVV Tokens stuck in VVVETHStaking contract

## Summary

The `VVVETHStaking.sol` contract is expected to hold `VVV tokens` to distribute to the stakers as rewards:

```javascript
    /**
        @notice Claims $VVV for a user
        @param _vvvAmount The amount of $VVV to claim
     */
    function claimVvv(uint256 _vvvAmount) external {
        if (_vvvAmount == 0) revert CantClaimZeroVvv();

        uint256 claimableVvv = calculateClaimableVvvAmount();
        if (_vvvAmount > claimableVvv) revert InsufficientClaimableVvv();

        userVvvClaimed[msg.sender] += _vvvAmount;

@>      vvvToken.safeTransfer(msg.sender, _vvvAmount);

        emit VvvClaim(msg.sender, _vvvAmount);
    }
```

Although the admins can send `VVV Tokens` in the contract, there is no way getting them out of the contract. `VVVETHStaking.sol` doesn't implement any function that approves an address to transfer `VVV Tokens` and it doesn't implement an function that transfers `VVV Tokens` other than the `VVVETHStaking::claimVvv` function. This is especially problematic because the `VVV Token` implements a max supply cap and any tokens sent in the contract would be essentially burned, unless claimed by users:

```javascript
constructor(
        uint256 _cap,
        uint256 _initialSupply,
        address _authorizationRegistryAddress
    )
        ERC20("vVvToken", "VVV")
@>      ERC20Capped(_cap)
        VVVAuthorizationRegistryChecker(_authorizationRegistryAddress)
    {
        _mint(msg.sender, _initialSupply);
    }
```

## Vulnerability Detail

In the contest details, it is noted that the contracts are expected to interact with the ERC20 `VVV Token`. The interaction with this token is incomplete since there is no way to retrieve stuck tokens from the `VVVETHStaking.sol` contract.

## Impact

`VVV Tokens` stuck in the `VVVETHStaking.sol` contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider adding an `ADMIN` only withdraw function to unstuck the tokens:

```javascript
    function withdrawVvv(uint256 _vvvAmount) external onlyAuthorized {
        if (_vvvAmount == 0) revert();

        vvvToken.safeTransfer(msg.sender, _vvvAmount);
    }

```
