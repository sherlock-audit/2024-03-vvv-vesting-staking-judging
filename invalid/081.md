# Potential Array Length Mismatch in `setDurationMultipliers`

## Summary
The `setDurationMultipliers` function in the `VVVETHStaking` contract is designed to update the reward multipliers for various staking durations. It accepts two arrays, `_duration` and `_multipliers`, and iterates through them using only `_duration`'s length without verifying that they are of the same length.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
function setDurationMultipliers(
        StakingDuration[] memory _duration,
        uint256[] memory _multipliers
) external onlyAuthorized {
@>        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _duration.length; ++i) {
            durationToMultiplier[_duration[i]] = _multipliers[i];
          }
}
```
## Impact
1. **Incorrect Multiplier Assignment**: If `_multipliers` is longer than `_duration`, excess multipliers will be ignored, potentially leading to incorrect configurations for staking rewards.
2. **Index Out of Bounds**: If `_multipliers` is shorter than `_duration`, the loop will attempt to access an index of `_multipliers` that does not exist, causing a runtime error and reverting the transaction.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a check to ensure that `_duration` and `_multipliers` arrays are of equal length before proceeding with the update loop.
```solidity
function setDurationMultipliers(
        StakingDuration[] memory _duration,
        uint256[] memory _multipliers
) external onlyAuthorized {
        if (_duration.length != _multipliers.length) revert InconsistentLength();
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _duration.length; ++i) {
            durationToMultiplier[_duration[i]] = _multipliers[i];
        }
}
```
