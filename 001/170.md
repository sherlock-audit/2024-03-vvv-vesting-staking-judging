# If userStakes/userStakesId array becomes large enough it can cause a user to not claimVvv tokens

## Summary
If userStakes/userStakesId array becomes large enough it can cause a user to not claimVvv tokens because it would require a lot of gas to execute the transaction.
## Vulnerability Detail
Following is stakeEth function 
```solidity
function stakeEth(
        StakingDuration _stakeDuration
    ) external payable whenStakingIsPermitted returns (uint256) {
        _stakeEth(_stakeDuration, msg.value);
        return stakeId;
    }

 function _stakeEth(StakingDuration _stakeDuration, uint256 _stakedEthAmount) private {
        if (_stakedEthAmount == 0) revert CantStakeZeroEth();
        ++stakeId;

        userStakes[msg.sender][stakeId] = StakeData({
            stakedEthAmount: uint224(_stakedEthAmount),
            stakeStartTimestamp: uint32(block.timestamp),
            stakeIsWithdrawn: false,
            stakeDuration: _stakeDuration
        });

        _userStakeIds[msg.sender].push(stakeId);

        emit Stake(
            msg.sender,
            stakeId,
            uint224(_stakedEthAmount),
            uint32(block.timestamp),
            _stakeDuration
        );
    }

```
As can be seen whenever a user calls the stake eth function new stakeId is used and pushed to  _userStakeIds

Now below is claimVvv function
```solidity
 function claimVvv(uint256 _vvvAmount) external {
        if (_vvvAmount == 0) revert CantClaimZeroVvv();

        uint256 claimableVvv = calculateClaimableVvvAmount();
        if (_vvvAmount > claimableVvv) revert InsufficientClaimableVvv();

        userVvvClaimed[msg.sender] += _vvvAmount;

        vvvToken.safeTransfer(msg.sender, _vvvAmount);

        emit VvvClaim(msg.sender, _vvvAmount);
    }
```
ClaimableVvv tokens are calculated using the following function
```solidity
 function calculateClaimableVvvAmount() public view returns (uint256) {
        return calculateAccruedVvvAmount() - userVvvClaimed[msg.sender];
    }
```
Which calls the calculateAccruedVvvAmount function 
```solidity
 function calculateAccruedVvvAmount() public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256[] memory stakeIds = _userStakeIds[msg.sender];
        if (stakeIds.length == 0) return 0;

        uint256 totalVvvAccrued;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < stakeIds.length; ++i) {
            StakeData memory stake = userStakes[msg.sender][stakeIds[i]];
            unchecked {
                totalVvvAccrued += calculateAccruedVvvAmount(stake);
            }
        }

        return totalVvvAccrued;
    }
```
calculateAccruedVvvAmount(stake) function calculated the correct amount of tokens the user is eligible to claim

Now the issue lies in the above function as you can see the for loop iterates over all the userStakesIds even if the user has already claimed the tokens for that particular stakeId. So now if this array becomes large enough then it wouldn't allow the user to claim tokens because it would revert because of block gas limit reached.


## Impact
User won't be able to claim their eligible VVV tokens.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Maybe once a user has claimed all the eligible tokens for that stakeId delete that stake and deduct the claimed amount from the userVvvClaimed mapping.
