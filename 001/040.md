# Users can front run `VVVETHStaking::setDurationMultipliers()` to maximize their rewards.

## Summary
When the `setDurationMultipliers()` function is called by the `onlyAuthorized` address, it can be front runned by malicious users to maximize their rewards.
## Vulnerability Detail
While calculating the reward for a user , `durationToMultiplier[_stake.stakeDuration]` is considered into calculation. Changing this value would result in either an increase or decrease in the amount of reward for a user.

```javascript
function calculateAccruedVvvAmount(StakeData memory _stake) public view returns (uint256) {
       ...
       ...
            accruedVvv =
                (nominalAccruedEth * ethToVvvExchangeRate() * durationToMultiplier[_stake.stakeDuration]) /
                DENOMINATOR;
       ...
       ...
    }
```
If a malicious user monitoring the mempool sees that that the `durationToMultiplier[_stake.stakeDuration]` is being decreased , then he/she would immediately frontrun and call `claimVvv()` function and would claim all his VVV tokens before the value of the `durationToMultiplier` is being decremented.

## Impact
Malicious user gets more VVV tokens than he/she should have received.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add and call pause/unpause methods to the `claimVVV()` function before and after calling the `setDurationMultipliers()` function respectively so that the users cant claim while the values are being changed.
