# Too many stakes can prevent the staker from claiming their accrued vVv tokens

## Summary

Since a for loop is used to calculate total vVv accrued over a user's staking duration, having too many stakes (> 12,808 approx.) can lead to a permanent lock in of all those tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

The [claimVvv](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-vvv-vesting-staking/blob/2d3540ab8f421055dba60d47e948e1cc55f0a0c7/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/staking/VVVETHStaking.sol#L183) function uses the [calculateAccruedVvvAmount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-vvv-vesting-staking/blob/2d3540ab8f421055dba60d47e948e1cc55f0a0c7/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/staking/VVVETHStaking.sol#L201) function internally to calculate the `totalVvvAccrued` for a user. The `calculateAccruedVvvAmount` function loops over all the stakes of that user and adds up all the `accruedVvv` for all his stakes. 

Therefore, if there are too many stakes of that user, this loop could cause an OOG error, not allowing that user to claim their vVv tokens.

Through the following PoC, I have reached a figure of ~12,808 as the maximum no. of times a user can _safely_ stake their ETH. Staking even one more time consumes more than 30 million gas, which is the current block gas limit of Ethereum.

```solidity
    function testClaimingVvvWithTooManyStakes() public {
        vm.startPrank(sampleUser);

        // a user stakes too many times
        for (uint i = 0; i < 12_809; i++) {
            EthStakingInstance.stakeEth{ value: 1 ether }(VVVETHStaking.StakingDuration.OneYear);
        }

        skip(360 days);

        uint256 allVvv = EthStakingInstance.calculateClaimableVvvAmount();

        // after 360 days, the user tries to claim their accrued vVv tokens, but unfortunately, they couldn't
        uint gB = gasleft();
        EthStakingInstance.claimVvv{gas: 30_000_000}(allVvv);
        console.log("gas consumed", gB - gasleft());
    }
```

Add the above test case inside `VVVETHStaking.unit.t.sol` test file and run it using `forge test --mt testClaimingVvvWithTooManyStakes -vvv`. The test would fail with the error `EvmError: OutOfGas`. On staking 12,808 times, you could clearly see that claiming vVv costs ~29,997,748 which is just 2,252 gas short of the block gas limit of Ethereum.

## Impact

Unintentional DoS as there would be no way to claim vVv tokens if a users stakes too many times.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Introduce an upper limit to the no. of times a user can stake their ETH.

This check can be added to the internal [_stakeEth](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-vvv-vesting-staking/blob/2d3540ab8f421055dba60d47e948e1cc55f0a0c7/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/staking/VVVETHStaking.sol#L290) function in the following manner:


```diff
+    uint256 MAX_STAKES_LIMIT = 10_000;
+    error MaxStakesReached();
    ///@notice Private function to stake ETH, used by both stakeEth and restakeEth
    function _stakeEth(StakingDuration _stakeDuration, uint256 _stakedEthAmount) private {
        if (_stakedEthAmount == 0) revert CantStakeZeroEth();
+       if(_userStakeIds[msg.sender].length == MAX_STAKES_LIMIT) revert MaxStakesReached();
```

Note that while deciding the `MAX_STAKES_LIMIT` the block gas limit of the Avalanche C Chain which is currently 15 million must also be taken into consideration, as it is mentioned in the contest page that the staking contract could possibly also get deployed there.
