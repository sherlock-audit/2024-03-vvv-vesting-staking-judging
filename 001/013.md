# If the stake rewards are slashed by decreasing the durationToMultiplier ratio it can indefinitely prevent future reward claiming for new stakes

## Summary

The staking mechanism in the vVv protocol allows old stakes which have finished, have been withdrawn to still be accounted for when calculating reward accrual. Since `userVvvClaimed` or the total claimed vVv by a user is calculated on an address level instead of a stakeId, this affects all stakes whether active/inactive.

The problem arises when a user who has had a previous stake for which they've claimed the staking rewards creates a new one. If the staking rewards have been slashed in the meantime (`durationToMultiplier` decreased), the user will never be able to claim their rewards for their new stake (if the new staked ETH amount is smaller then their previous one) as long as the `durationToMultiplier` isn't the same or higher than their previous stake. 

## Vulnerability Detail

When users claim their rewards , they're tracked in this mapping:
`userVvvClaimed[msg.sender] += _vvvAmount;`

The mechanism which prevents users claiming more tokens than they're eligible to, meaning they can't claim more than once the amount that they're entitled to according to their stake amount, stake duration and the `durationToMultiplier` due to the following condition in the `calculateClaimableVvvAmount()` function:

`return calculateAccruedVvvAmount() - userVvvClaimed[msg.sender];`

When a staking period for a certain `stakeId` is finished and the funds withdrawn, they're still accounted for in the system and when calculating rewards accrual. 

If a user has had a stake for which they've claimed rewards in their entirety, and now have  a new one (which is smaller than the previous one) but at the same time the staking rewards were slashed by decreasing the `durationToMultiplier`, they will never be able to claim rewards for their new stake due to panic rewards because of underflow/overflow, this is due to `calculateAccruedVvvAmount()` being less than `userVvvClaimed[msg.sender]`.

**PoC**

```solidity

    function testWithdrawNew() public {
        vm.startPrank(sampleUser, sampleUser);
        uint256 stakeEthAmount = 9 ether;
        uint256 stakeId = EthStakingInstance.stakeEth{value: stakeEthAmount}(VVVETHStaking.StakingDuration.ThreeMonths);

        // forward to first timestamp with released stake
        advanceBlockNumberAndTimestampInSeconds(
            EthStakingInstance.durationToSeconds(VVVETHStaking.StakingDuration.ThreeMonths) + 1
        );

        // Claim vVv

        uint256 claimableVvv = EthStakingInstance.calculateClaimableVvvAmount();

        EthStakingInstance.claimVvv(claimableVvv);
        console.log("Claimable vVv: ", claimableVvv);

        //Withdraw stake

        EthStakingInstance.withdrawStake(stakeId);

        //Ensure no claimable vVv
        uint256 claimableVvv1 = EthStakingInstance.calculateClaimableVvvAmount();
        console.log("Claimable stake after claim: ", claimableVvv1);

        vm.stopPrank();

        //Decrease multiplier values

        vm.startPrank(ethStakingManager, ethStakingManager);
        VVVETHStaking.StakingDuration[] memory durations = new VVVETHStaking.StakingDuration[](3);
        durations[0] = VVVETHStaking.StakingDuration.ThreeMonths;
        durations[1] = VVVETHStaking.StakingDuration.SixMonths;
        durations[2] = VVVETHStaking.StakingDuration.OneYear;

        uint256[] memory multipliers = new uint256[](3);
        multipliers[0] = 7_000;
        multipliers[1] = 30_000;
        multipliers[2] = 35_000;

        EthStakingInstance.setDurationMultipliers(durations, multipliers);

        vm.stopPrank();

        //Any attempts to claim rewards will panic revert after staking again

        vm.startPrank(sampleUser, sampleUser);

        uint256 stakeEthAmount1 = 0.5 ether;
        uint256 stakeId1 =
            EthStakingInstance.stakeEth{value: stakeEthAmount1}(VVVETHStaking.StakingDuration.ThreeMonths);
        // forward to first timestamp with released stake
        advanceBlockNumberAndTimestampInSeconds(
            EthStakingInstance.durationToSeconds(VVVETHStaking.StakingDuration.ThreeMonths) + 1
        );

        vm.expectRevert();
        uint256 claimableVvv2 = EthStakingInstance.calculateClaimableVvvAmount();
        vm.stopPrank();
    }

```


## Impact

Because expired/claimed stakes are calculated during reward calculation, users who've had larger stakes in the past won't be able to claim rewards for their newer lesser stakes if the stake rewards have been slashed in the meantime.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

`durationToMultiplier` can be tracked per individual `stakeId` as part of the struct and `userVvvClaimed[msg.sender]` can also be tracked per `stakeId` to avoid collision with past/future stakes.
