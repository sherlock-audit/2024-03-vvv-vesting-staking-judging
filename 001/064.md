# Incorrect initial setting of the $VVV accrual multiplier for each duration

## Summary
Due to incorrect initial setting of the $VVV accrual multiplier for each duration, the staker suffers losses in $VVV claims.
## Vulnerability Detail
In `VVVETHStaken.sol#constructor()`, the $VVV occurrence multiplier for each period is set as follows.
```solidity
    constructor(
        address _authorizationRegistryAddress
    ) VVVAuthorizationRegistryChecker(_authorizationRegistryAddress) {
        durationToSeconds[StakingDuration.ThreeMonths] = 90 days;
        durationToSeconds[StakingDuration.SixMonths] = 180 days;
        durationToSeconds[StakingDuration.OneYear] = 360 days;

114:    durationToMultiplier[StakingDuration.ThreeMonths] = 10_000;
115:    durationToMultiplier[StakingDuration.SixMonths] = 15_000;
        durationToMultiplier[StakingDuration.OneYear] = 30_000;
    }
```

Additionally, the total $VVV amount generated by a single stake is calculated as follows:
```solidity
    function calculateAccruedVvvAmount(StakeData memory _stake) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 stakeDuration = durationToSeconds[_stake.stakeDuration];
        uint256 secondsSinceStakingStarted = block.timestamp - _stake.stakeStartTimestamp;
        uint256 secondsStaked;
        uint256 nominalAccruedEth;
        uint256 accruedVvv;

        unchecked {
230:        secondsStaked = secondsSinceStakingStarted >= stakeDuration
                ? stakeDuration
                : secondsSinceStakingStarted;

234:        nominalAccruedEth = (secondsStaked * _stake.stakedEthAmount) / stakeDuration;

236:        accruedVvv =
                (nominalAccruedEth * ethToVvvExchangeRate() * durationToMultiplier[_stake.stakeDuration]) /
                DENOMINATOR;
        }

        return accruedVvv;
    }
```

Due to incorrect settings of the $VVV accrual multiplier for `StakingDuration.ThreeMonths` and `StakingDuration.SixMonths`, stakers suffer losses in the amount of $VVV to be claimed. 
Let's look at the example below. 

For example: 
For simplicity, let us assume that the staker claims $VVV after the duration has elapsed for a single stake.
Let's say Bob sets `_stakeDuration` to `ThreeMonths` and stakes 1000 ETH.
After the duration expires, Bob calls `retakeEth` again with `_stakeDuration` set to `ThreeMonths`. 
Then when Bob calls `withdrawStake()`, he will receive `claimableVvv=1000*1*10000/10000 + 1000*1*10000/10000 = 2000` $VVV.
However, If Bob initially sets `_stakeDuration` to `SixMonths` and stakes 1000 ETH, he will receive `claimableVvv=1000*1*15000/10000 = 1500` $VVV.
As a result, Bob loses 500 $VVV.
## Impact
The $VVV amount to be charged is inconsistent.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Re-determine the initial $VVV accrual multiplier for each duration base on the `StakingDuraion`.
