# `VVVETHStaking::_stakeEth` & `VVVETHStaking::claimVvv`  Service Disruption via Excessive Small Stakes and Withdrawals

## Summary
 The `_stakeEth` and `claimVvv` functions in the `VVVETHStaking.sol` contract are vulnerable to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack due to the absence of a minimum staking amount check. Attackers can exploit this by creating a large number of very small stakes`(1wei)` , potentially causing excessive gas costs and state bloat, which can hinder legitimate users' interactions with the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
- The `_stakeEth` function allows users to stake any amount of ETH, including very small quantities.
- The `claimVvv` function allows users to withdraw their stakes without any restrictions on the number of stakes or the staked amount.

Here - 
- An attacker can repeatedly call _stakeEth with minuscule amounts of ETH, creating numerous stakes.
- Each stake increases the contract's state, leading to higher gas costs for iterating over stakes.
- Legitimate users will face increased gas costs and potential inability to interact with the contract due to gas limits.

```solidity
    function _stakeEth(StakingDuration _stakeDuration, uint256 _stakedEthAmount) private {
        if (_stakedEthAmount == 0) revert CantStakeZeroEth();
       //@audit - Not checking for minimum amount to stake
        ++stakeId;

        userStakes[msg.sender][stakeId] = StakeData({
            stakedEthAmount: uint224(_stakedEthAmount),
            stakeStartTimestamp: uint32(block.timestamp),
            stakeIsWithdrawn: false,
            stakeDuration: _stakeDuration
        });

        _userStakeIds[msg.sender].push(stakeId);

        emit Stake(
            msg.sender,
            stakeId,
            uint224(_stakedEthAmount),
            uint32(block.timestamp),
            _stakeDuration
        );
    }
```

```solidity
    function claimVvv(uint256 _vvvAmount) external {
        if (_vvvAmount == 0) revert CantClaimZeroVvv();
//@audit - Not checking minimum amount to be withdrawn
        uint256 claimableVvv = calculateClaimableVvvAmount();
        if (_vvvAmount > claimableVvv) revert InsufficientClaimableVvv();

        userVvvClaimed[msg.sender] += _vvvAmount;

        vvvToken.safeTransfer(msg.sender, _vvvAmount);

        emit VvvClaim(msg.sender, _vvvAmount);
    }
```


An attacker can automate transactions by calling _stakeEth with 1 wei of ETH repeatedly. This can be done until the contract's storage is excessively bloated, or the _userStakeIds array becomes too large to iterate over within reasonable gas limits.

## Impact
The governance/user would have to spend as much gas as the attacker in order to prevent the DoS attack and process these functions.

## Recommendation
Implement a minimum staking and claimVvv amount. For e.g. 1 dollar
