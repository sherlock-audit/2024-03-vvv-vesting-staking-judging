# Exchange Rate Hardcoded

## Summary

The protocol wishes to give VVV tokens in exchange for ETH staked in the Staking Contract , but the exchange rate i.e. VVV/ETH has been hardcoded to 1 which can lead to bots taking advantage of price discrepancies. Ideally exchange rate should be calculated via oracles or some trusted source such as Uniswap pools.

## Vulnerability Detail

1.) Alice stakes 10 ETH for a stakeDuration of 3 months (i.e. durationToMultiplier[StakingDuration.ThreeMonths] = 10_000) ,
right now VVV is trading at 1:1 with ETH.

2.) After 3 months when she claims VVV at that point  exchange rate changes due to market fluctuations, and the new exchange rate becomes 1 ETH = 2 $VVV., the accrued VVV is calculates here https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-vvv-vesting-staking/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/staking/VVVETHStaking.sol#L237

```solidity
accruedVvv =
                (nominalAccruedEth * ethToVvvExchangeRate() * durationToMultiplier[_stake.stakeDuration]) /
                DENOMINATOR;
        }
```
Therefore this will come out to be 10 VVV token accrued , while it should have been 20 VVV tokens due to market conditions.
Or simply put , if VVV crashes (say 1 ETH = 1000 VVV) even then the user would get 10 VVV which is practically worthless.

## Impact

The exchange rate is not subject to market volatility and might result in way lesser VVV tokens being transferred to the staker

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Exchange rate should not be hardcoded , calculate the exchange price using oracles.
