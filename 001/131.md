## Summary
The claimVvv function allows users to claim $VVV tokens even after they have withdrawn their stakes. This is possible because the function fails to check the state of stake before adding it to the claimable amount for a User.
## Vulnerability Detail
The claimVvv function allows users to claim $VVV tokens even after they have withdrawn their stakes. Although there is no issue with a user claiming tokens after withdrawing their stake. The issue lies in the fact they continue to accrue tokens without even without completing the duration of their stake. The claimVvv() function calls the calculateAccruedVvvAmount()  which further calls the calculateAccruedVvvAmount(), that calculates the vvv tokens a user is eligible based on the time passed since user have staked their tokens.   In the calculateAccruedVvvAmount(), the accruedvvv is calculated by multiplying the nominalAccruedEth * ethToVvvExchangeRate() * durationToMultiplier[_stake.stakeDuration].   nominalAccruedEth is gotten by (secondsStaked * _stake.stakedEthAmount) / stakeDuration).  


Because secondsSinceStakingStarted calculates at the current timestamp instead of when staking was withdrawn, user gets more tokens than they are eligible for.
  uint256 secondsSinceStakingStarted = block.timestamp - _stake.stakeStartTimestamp;
```solidity
function calculateAccruedVvvAmount(StakeData memory _stake) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 stakeDuration = durationToSeconds[_stake.stakeDuration];
        uint256 secondsSinceStakingStarted = block.timestamp - _stake.stakeStartTimestamp;
        uint256 secondsStaked;
        uint256 nominalAccruedEth;
        uint256 accruedVvv;

        unchecked {
            secondsStaked = secondsSinceStakingStarted >= stakeDuration
                ? stakeDuration
                : secondsSinceStakingStarted;

            nominalAccruedEth = (secondsStaked * _stake.stakedEthAmount) / stakeDuration;

            accruedVvv =
                (nominalAccruedEth * ethToVvvExchangeRate() * durationToMultiplier[_stake.stakeDuration]) /
                DENOMINATOR;
        }

        return accruedVvv;
    }
```
## Impact
Financial Loss: Users can exploit this vulnerability to accumulate additional $VVV tokens without having an active stake. This undermines the economic model and may lead to financial losses for the project.
Inflation: Continued accrual of $VVV rewards for withdrawn stakes can inflate the total supply of $VVV tokens beyond the intended distribution.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function claimVvv(uint256 _vvvAmount) external {
        if (_vvvAmount == 0) revert CantClaimZeroVvv();

        uint256 claimableVvv = calculateClaimableVvvAmount();
        if (_vvvAmount > claimableVvv) revert InsufficientClaimableVvv();

        userVvvClaimed[msg.sender] += _vvvAmount;

        vvvToken.safeTransfer(msg.sender, _vvvAmount);

        emit VvvClaim(msg.sender, _vvvAmount);
    }

    function calculateAccruedVvvAmount() public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256[] memory stakeIds = _userStakeIds[msg.sender];
        if (stakeIds.length == 0) return 0;
        //stakeIds.length is not cache which can be increased to high levels by user
        //halting protocol

        uint256 totalVvvAccrued;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < stakeIds.length; ++i) {
            StakeData memory stake = userStakes[msg.sender][stakeIds[i]];
            unchecked {
                totalVvvAccrued += calculateAccruedVvvAmount(stake);
            }
        }

        return totalVvvAccrued;
    }

   function calculateAccruedVvvAmount(StakeData memory _stake) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 stakeDuration = durationToSeconds[_stake.stakeDuration];
        uint256 secondsSinceStakingStarted = block.timestamp - _stake.stakeStartTimestamp;
        uint256 secondsStaked;
        uint256 nominalAccruedEth;
        uint256 accruedVvv;

        unchecked {
            secondsStaked = secondsSinceStakingStarted >= stakeDuration
                ? stakeDuration
                : secondsSinceStakingStarted;

            nominalAccruedEth = (secondsStaked * _stake.stakedEthAmount) / stakeDuration;

            accruedVvv =
                (nominalAccruedEth * ethToVvvExchangeRate() * durationToMultiplier[_stake.stakeDuration]) /
                DENOMINATOR;
        }

        return accruedVvv;
    }
```

## Tool used
Manual review

## Recommendation
 Timestamp should be updated for Users after withdrawing their stake.   stakeEndTime  should be added User information after withdrawing stake so that vvv tokens are withdrawn at exact time stake was withdrawn.
