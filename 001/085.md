# use of hardcoded ethToVvvExchange rate in VVVETHStaking::calculateClaimableVvvAmount

## Summary
VVV exchange rate being set to a fixed value of 1, will result in claimer getting more / less than intended amount to be recieved when actual exchange rate is greater / less than 1 
## Vulnerability Detail
The exchange rate of vvv token was set to always return a fixed  value of 1

and this value is crucial in the calculation of vvv amount to be claimed during claiming of vvv tokens
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-vvv-vesting-staking/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/staking/VVVETHStaking.sol#L236-L238

On occasions where the exchange rate of vvv/eth tokens is not equal to 1 in real time on exchanges, user will get less than / more than the intended amount to be sent to the user

## Impact
User claiming tokens when eth to vvv exchange is not equal to 1, will recieve $vvv value greater or less than the intended amount

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
use price oracles such as chainlink to get the exchange rate of eth to vvv tokens so that the exchange rate used for the calculation of claimVVV tallies with the actual exchange rate of eth/vvv
