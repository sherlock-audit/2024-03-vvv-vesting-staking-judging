# The $VVV accural multiplier for duration is applied uniformly.

## Summary
The $VVV accural multiplier for duration is applied uniformly to the entire duration, which may result in a loss of $VVV to the protocol or the staker.
## Vulnerability Detail
The total amount of $VVV accrued is calculated as follows.
```solidity
    function calculateAccruedVvvAmount(StakeData memory _stake) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 stakeDuration = durationToSeconds[_stake.stakeDuration];
        uint256 secondsSinceStakingStarted = block.timestamp - _stake.stakeStartTimestamp;
        uint256 secondsStaked;
        uint256 nominalAccruedEth;
        uint256 accruedVvv;

        unchecked {
230:        secondsStaked = secondsSinceStakingStarted >= stakeDuration
                ? stakeDuration
                : secondsSinceStakingStarted;

234:        nominalAccruedEth = (secondsStaked * _stake.stakedEthAmount) / stakeDuration;

236:        accruedVvv =
                (nominalAccruedEth * ethToVvvExchangeRate() * durationToMultiplier[_stake.stakeDuration]) /
                DENOMINATOR;
        }

        return accruedVvv;
    }
```

Additionally, the $VVV accural multiplier for duration is set as follows.
```solidity
    function setDurationMultipliers(
        StakingDuration[] memory _duration,
        uint256[] memory _multipliers
    ) external onlyAuthorized {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _duration.length; ++i) {
            durationToMultiplier[_duration[i]] = _multipliers[i];
        }
    }
```
As you can see on the above code snippet, once the $VVV accural multiplier is set, it is uniformly applied to the entire staking period.
Letâ€™s consider the following scenario:
Let's say Bob stakes 1000 ETH when the accural multiplier is 10000 (`_stakeDuration = ThreeMonths`).
Let's say that after 45 days, the manager sets the issuance multiplier to 20000.
At this time, until the point where the accural multiplier is set, the accural amount of $VVV must be calculated according to the previous accural multiplier, but since it is calculated according to the newly set accural multiplier, the protocol causes more $VVV to be accured.
When Bob charges $VVV after duration expires, he will receive `claimableVVV = 1000*1*20000/10000 = 2000` $VVV.
However total claimable $VVV has to be `1000*(45/90)*1*10000/10000 + 1000*(45/90)*1*20000/10000 = 1500` $VVV.
As a result Bob will receive 500 $VVV more than before.
Likewise, if the accumulation multiplier goes down, the Bob suffers a corresponding loss.
## Impact
The protocol or the staker loses $VVV according to the $VVV accural multiplier.

## Recommendation
Consider the accumulation mechanism that follows when the accumulation multiplier is set.
When setting the accumulation multiplier, keep the previous accumulation multiplier and calculate the $VVV accumulation amount based on it.
