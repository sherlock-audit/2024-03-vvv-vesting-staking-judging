# Incorrect VVV token rewards for Staking as `ethToVvvExchangeRate` changes

## Summary

`ethToVvvExchangeRate` is the exchange rate between eth and VVV token, and it is used to calculate the VVV token reward at the time of claiming VVV tokens which result in uncertainty in the rewards.

## Vulnerability Detail

1. Suppose the current `ethToVvvExchangeRate` is 1.
2. User stake 100 Eth for 3 month duration.
3. After 3 months user expect to get 100 VVV tokens as the `ethToVvvExchangeRate` is 1 and `durationToMultiplier` is 10_000.
4. But the current `ethToVvvExchangeRate` at the time of staking is not begin store anywhere.
5. After 3 months, the `ethToVvvExchangeRate` changes to lets say 2 and the rewards is calculated using current `ethToVvvExchangeRate`
6. Now when the user claim their VVV tokens they will get 200 VVV tokens instead of 100.

- Run this test in `VVVETHStaking.unit.t.sol`

* NOTE: `ethToVvvExchangeRate` is a placeholder, so we can't really change it right now, so in the test we are using `newEthToVvvExchangeRate`/`oldEthToVvvExchangeRate` to simulate the exchange rate changes.

```javascript
    function testUserGetsIncorrectRewardAsExchangeRateChanges() public {
        // user stakes 100 ethers
        address USER = makeAddr("user");
        uint256 startingBalance = 100 ether;
        vm.deal(USER, startingBalance);
        vm.startPrank(USER);
        // user staking 100 ethers for 3 months
        EthStakingInstance.stakeEth{value: startingBalance}(VVVETHStaking.StakingDuration.ThreeMonths);

        // accruedVvv = (nominalAccruedEth * ethToVvvExchangeRate() * durationToMultiplier[_stake.stakeDuration]) / DENOMINATOR;
        // accrued Vvv is directly proportional to ethToVvvExchangeRate()
        // the current exchange rate is 1
        uint256 oldEthToVvvExchangeRate = EthStakingInstance.ethToVvvExchangeRate();

        //  3 months passed
        vm.warp(164107080010293091822);
        vm.roll(100);

        uint256 expectedReward = EthStakingInstance.calculateAccruedVvvAmount();
        vm.stopPrank();

        // the exchange rate changed to lets say 2
        uint256 newEthToVvvExchangeRate = 2;

        // user claim their rewards
        vm.startPrank(USER);
        uint256 actualReward =
            EthStakingInstance.calculateAccruedVvvAmount() * newEthToVvvExchangeRate / oldEthToVvvExchangeRate;
        vm.stopPrank();

        console.log("expected reward: ", expectedReward);
        console.log("actual reward: ", actualReward);

        assert(expectedReward != actualReward);
    }
```

## Impact

- Users getting incorrect VVV token rewards for staking

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- store the `ethToVvvExchangeRate` at the time of staking in the `struct StakeData` of the user and chagne the entire contract accordingly
- use this `ethToVvvExchangeRate` that is store in the `struct StakeData` to calculate the rewards.

```diff
    struct StakeData {
        uint224 stakedEthAmount;
        uint32 stakeStartTimestamp;
        bool stakeIsWithdrawn;
+       uint256 ethToVvvExchangeRate
        StakingDuration stakeDuration;
    }
    .
    .
    .
    function calculateAccruedVvvAmount(StakeData memory _stake) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 stakeDuration = durationToSeconds[_stake.stakeDuration];
        uint256 secondsSinceStakingStarted = block.timestamp - _stake.stakeStartTimestamp;
        uint256 secondsStaked;
        uint256 nominalAccruedEth;
        uint256 accruedVvv;

        unchecked {
            secondsStaked = secondsSinceStakingStarted >= stakeDuration ? stakeDuration : secondsSinceStakingStarted;

            nominalAccruedEth = (secondsStaked * _stake.stakedEthAmount) / stakeDuration;
-           accruedVvv =
-               (nominalAccruedEth * ethToVvvExchangeRate() * durationToMultiplier[_stake.stakeDuration]) / DENOMINATOR;
+           accruedVvv = (nominalAccruedEth * _stake.ethToVvvExchangeRate * durationToMultiplier[_stake.stakeDuration]) / DENOMINATOR;
        }

        return accruedVvv;
    }
    .
    .
    .
    function _stakeEth(StakingDuration _stakeDuration, uint256 _stakedEthAmount) private {
        if (_stakedEthAmount == 0) revert CantStakeZeroEth();
        ++stakeId;

        userStakes[msg.sender][stakeId] = StakeData({
            stakedEthAmount: uint224(_stakedEthAmount),
            stakeStartTimestamp: uint32(block.timestamp),
            stakeIsWithdrawn: false,
+           ethToVvvExchangeRate: ethToVvvExchangeRate(),
            stakeDuration: _stakeDuration
        });

        _userStakeIds[msg.sender].push(stakeId);

        emit Stake(msg.sender, stakeId, uint224(_stakedEthAmount), uint32(block.timestamp), _stakeDuration);
    }
```
