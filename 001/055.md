# `claimVvv` function can be DoSed in a long term

## Summary
It is not possible to reduce the length of `_userStakeIds[msg.sender]`, which will cause it to exceed the block gas limit in long-term usage. As a result, `claimVvv` function will be unusable. 

## Vulnerability Detail
There is no way to clear `StakeId` inside the `_userStakeIds[_user]` and `calculateAccruedVvvAmount` function has a for loop that calculates accrued Vvv amount for each `StakeId`. At some point, this function will require more gas than block gas limit. 
  
Also, Avalanche C-Chain has half the block gas limit compared to mainnet.

## Impact
Loyal users who have used the system for a long time become unable to claim Vvv token.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Rewarded `stakeId`s should be removed from `calculateAccruedVvvAmount` but it requires multiple changes in code.
