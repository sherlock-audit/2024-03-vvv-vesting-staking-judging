# Griefing of Protocol via calculateAccruedVvvAmount()

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-vvv-vesting-staking/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/staking/VVVETHStaking.sol#L201-L214
## Summary
The calculateAccruedVvvAmount function allows users to exploit a vulnerability, potentially leading to unauthorized gains. This vulnerability undermines the integrity of the protocol.
## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability arises from the following aspects of the function.
 ```solidity
 mapping(address => uint256[]) private _userStakeIds;
```
This mapping stores the total stakes a particular user have made on the protocol.
when calculateAccruedVvvAmount() is called by a user to check the total amount of vvv tokens they have accrued, the whole array is iterated.
```solidity
   for (uint256 i = 0; i < stakeIds.length; ++i) {
```
 This itself is not the issue, the issues lies in the fact that a user can accumulates unlimited amount of stake Ids by calling restakeEth(). which doesn't delete Ids for withdrawn stakes.
As such when a  user calls calculateAccruedVvvAmount() it processes a huge amount data which might be to large for the protocol to handle. 
Also the functions doesn't cache the stakeIds.length



## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function calculateAccruedVvvAmount() public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256[] memory stakeIds = _userStakeIds[msg.sender];
        if (stakeIds.length == 0) return 0;

        uint256 totalVvvAccrued;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < stakeIds.length; ++i) {
            StakeData memory stake = userStakes[msg.sender][stakeIds[i]];
            unchecked {
                totalVvvAccrued += calculateAccruedVvvAmount(stake);
            }
        }

        return totalVvvAccrued;
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address this issue:
Implement checks to prevent users from creating excessive or empty stakes solely for reward accumulation.
Also stakeIds.length; should be cached
```solidity
    function calculateAccruedVvvAmount() public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256[] memory stakeIds = _userStakeIds[msg.sender];
        if (stakeIds.length == 0) return 0;

        uint256 totalVvvAccrued;
     uint256 stakeid =  stakeIds.length
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < stakeid; ++i) {
            StakeData memory stake = userStakes[msg.sender][stakeIds[i]];
            unchecked {
                totalVvvAccrued += calculateAccruedVvvAmount(stake);
            }
        }

        return totalVvvAccrued;
    }
```
