# User might be unable to claim their VVV due to OOG error

## Summary
An unbounded loop may cause user to be unable to claim their vvv

## Vulnerability Detail
Let's look at how claimable vvv is calculated: 
```solidity
    function calculateAccruedVvvAmount() public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256[] memory stakeIds = _userStakeIds[msg.sender];
        if (stakeIds.length == 0) return 0;

        uint256 totalVvvAccrued;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < stakeIds.length; ++i) {
            StakeData memory stake = userStakes[msg.sender][stakeIds[i]];
            unchecked {
                totalVvvAccrued += calculateAccruedVvvAmount(stake);
            }
        }

        return totalVvvAccrued;
    }
```

It loops over all user stakes and runs a gas-heavy `calculateAccruedVvvAmount`. While this may not seem as a problem at first glance, if a user has a large number of stakes, it may cause this function to revert due to Out-Of-Gas error. In this case, the user will no longer be able to claim any of their vvv.



## Impact
Loss of yield

## Recommendation
add a function which allows claiming vvv one by one stakes
