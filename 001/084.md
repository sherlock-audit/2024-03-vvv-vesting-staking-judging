# Inefficient Reward Calculation in `VVVETHStaking` Contract

## Summary
The current implementation of reward calculation in the `VVVETHStaking` contract is inefficient and consumes excessive gas. The contract loops over all user stakes to calculate accrued rewards, which can lead to high gas costs, especially when users have staked a large number of times. This inefficiency can impact the contract's scalability and user experience.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `calculateAccruedVvvAmount` function in the `VVVETHStaking` contract involves looping over all user stakes and calculating the amount for each stake based on the staked amount and duration. This process consumes a significant amount of gas, particularly when users have staked multiple times. Furthermore, if a user claims tokens and then adds a new stake after the staking duration, the function recalculates rewards from the first stake, leading to redundant calculations and increased gas costs.

## Impact
The inefficient reward calculation method significantly increases gas costs, especially for users with multiple stakes. The contract's reliance on looping over all user stakes for each reward calculation leads to higher gas consumption. This can result in a poor user experience, as users may incur high transaction fees when interacting with the contract.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To improve efficiency and reduce gas costs, consider implementing the following best practices for calculating total rewards for stakes:

1.  Create a new struct to track the total rewards for withdrawn stakes and the total rewards claimed by the user. This struct can include fields such as `totalRewardsForWithdrawnStakes` and `totalRewardsClaimed`.
2. Modify the `userVvvClaimed` mapping to map the user address to this new struct. This allows for efficient tracking of total rewards for each user.
3. When a user calls the `withdrawStake` function, calculate the rewards to be claimed for that specific stake and increment the `totalRewardsForWithdrawnStakes` field in the user's struct. Remove the `stakeId` from the `_userStakeIds` array to indicate that the stake has been withdrawn.
4. When a user calls the `claimVvv` function, loop over the active stakes (those in the `_userStakeIds` array) and calculate the total rewards based on the `totalRewardsForWithdrawnStakes` and `totalRewardsClaimed` fields in the user's struct, as well as the rewards for the active stakes. Add this value to the rewards claimed by the user and update the `totalRewardsClaimed` field.

Implementing these changes ensures that reward calculations are only performed for active stakes, reducing gas costs and improving the overall efficiency of the contract.
