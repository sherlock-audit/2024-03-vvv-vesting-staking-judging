# Possible Dos preventing users from staking or restaking

## Summary
Possible Dos preventing users from staking or re-staking.

## Vulnerability Detail
An attacker exploits the vulnerability using a smart contract that allows them to repeatedly call the `stakeEth` function with the most minimum amount of Ether, as low as `1 wei`. By utilizing a loop to call the `stakeEth` function, the attacker continuously stakes these tiny amounts (1 wei) for `three months` for instance, aiming to `increment the number of stakeId` variable until it reaches its `maximum value` (but this wont be done at once). This aggressive staking tactic can lead to an `arithmetic overflow`, a situation where the `stakeId` variable exceeds its maximum value and wraps around to zero, potentially causing the smart contract to malfunction.

The attack will be orchestrated systematically and periodically, with the attacker incurring minimal costs in terms of gas fees as the staking contract would be deployed on the `Avalanche C-Chain` implying low gas fees while carrying the transactions, making the attack more feasible and cost-effective for the attacker.  After a certain period, typically three months as mentioned, or when the stake matures, the attacker `withdraws` the entire `staked amount and repeats the process`, aiming to reach the maximum `stakeId` once again. Thus the attacker `doesn't loose deposited Funds just gas fees`.

## Impact
Once the maximum `stakeId` is attained, any subsequent staking or restaking endeavors result in an arithmetic overflow and transaction reversal.

## Recommendation
The best way to prevent this attack is to make it more expensive. by setting a minimum  required staking amount
