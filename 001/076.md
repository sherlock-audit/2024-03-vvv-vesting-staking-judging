# Token loss to users over a period due to Division rounding in VVV amount Calculation

## Summary
The VVVETHStaking contract calculates the accrued VVV tokens for staked ETH using integer division, which results in truncation of any fractional token amounts.`The frequency of claiming rewards` can significantly impact the precision loss experienced by users. Specifically, users who claim their rewards more frequently, such as daily, will experience a higher cumulative loss over time due to the rounding down in each claim.

## Vulnerability Detail
In contract `VVVETHStaking` , `function:: calculateAccruedVvvAmount` 
```javascript
 function calculateAccruedVvvAmount(StakeData memory _stake) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 stakeDuration = durationToSeconds[_stake.stakeDuration];
        uint256 secondsSinceStakingStarted = block.timestamp - _stake.stakeStartTimestamp;
        uint256 secondsStaked;
        uint256 nominalAccruedEth;
        uint256 accruedVvv;

        unchecked {
            secondsStaked = secondsSinceStakingStarted >= stakeDuration
                ? stakeDuration
                : secondsSinceStakingStarted;

 -->          nominalAccruedEth = (secondsStaked * _stake.stakedEthAmount) / stakeDuration;

            accruedVvv =
                (nominalAccruedEth * ethToVvvExchangeRate() * durationToMultiplier[_stake.stakeDuration]) /
                DENOMINATOR;
        }

        return accruedVvv;
    }

```

## Impact
While the loss in each individual claim may be a fraction of a VVV token, when claims are made frequently, these fractional losses can accumulate to a significant amount. For example, a user staking a large amount of ETH and claiming rewards daily could lose approximately 10 VVV tokens over a 90-day staking period due to rounding down.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
`Fractional Tracking:` Implement a system to track accrued fractions of tokens that are not claimed due to rounding and credit them in subsequent claims.
