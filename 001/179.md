# Iteration over `stakeIds.length` in `VVVETHStaking.sol::calculateAccruedVvvAmount()` can result to rising gas costs for claiming vvv token by the stakers over time

## Summary
Iteration over `stakeIds.length` in `VVVETHStaking::calculateAccruedVvvAmount()` can result to rising gas costs for the stakers over time. Causing to increase the cost to call `VVVETHStaking::calculateClaimableVvvAmount()` and `VVVETHStaking::claimVvv`.

## Vulnerability Detail
As there is no minimum amount for staking, and each stake gains its own stakeId and increments the `stakeIds.length`, as the times goes on, the gas cost for this iteration rises when function `VVVETHStaking::calculateAccruedVvvAmount()` is called by the function `VVVETHStaking::calculateClaimableVvvAmount`. 

## Impact
As the time goes by, the gas costs to call `VVVETHStaking::calculateClaimableVvvAmount()` increases ( as it calls the calculateAccruedVvvAmount() function), so the cost to call `VVVETHStaking::claimVvv` increases (as this one calls `calculateClaimableVvvAmount`. 
So at the time of claiming the `_vvvAmount`, the cost of calling that function also goes up and up.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
a. Set a minimum amount for staking, preventing a user to stake a very little amount each time
b. Define a new variable to have the user's total stakes
