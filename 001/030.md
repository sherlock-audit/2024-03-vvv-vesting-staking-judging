# Reward calculation formula has big flaw

## Summary
Reward calculation formula has big flaw when calculation `VVV` tokens. It is better for a user to make many accounts or stake every quarter than stake for 6 or 12 months from 1 account.
## Vulnerability Detail
User can claim his `VVV` tokens rewards by calling `claimVvv()`:
```soldiity
    function claimVvv(uint256 _vvvAmount) external {
        if (_vvvAmount == 0) revert CantClaimZeroVvv();

        uint256 claimableVvv = calculateClaimableVvvAmount();
        if (_vvvAmount > claimableVvv) revert InsufficientClaimableVvv();

        userVvvClaimed[msg.sender] += _vvvAmount;

        vvvToken.safeTransfer(msg.sender, _vvvAmount);

        emit VvvClaim(msg.sender, _vvvAmount);
    }
```
This function call `calculateClaimableVvvAmount()` -> `calculateAccruedVvvAmount()` -> and finally `calculateAccruedVvvAmount()`:
```solidity
    function calculateAccruedVvvAmount(StakeData memory _stake) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 stakeDuration = durationToSeconds[_stake.stakeDuration];
        uint256 secondsSinceStakingStarted = block.timestamp - _stake.stakeStartTimestamp;
        uint256 secondsStaked;
        uint256 nominalAccruedEth;
        uint256 accruedVvv;

        unchecked {
            secondsStaked = secondsSinceStakingStarted >= stakeDuration
                ? stakeDuration
                : secondsSinceStakingStarted;

            nominalAccruedEth = (secondsStaked * _stake.stakedEthAmount) / stakeDuration;

            accruedVvv =
                (nominalAccruedEth * ethToVvvExchangeRate() * durationToMultiplier[_stake.stakeDuration]) /
                DENOMINATOR;
        }

        return accruedVvv;
    }
```

This is the function that calculates the rewards. This calculation takes into account the duration of the stake, the elapsed time since the stake was made, the staked amount of ETH, the ETH to $VVV exchange rate, and the rewards multiplier associated with the staking duration.

Let's see how the multipliers are:
```solidity
        durationToMultiplier[StakingDuration.ThreeMonths] = 10_000;
        durationToMultiplier[StakingDuration.SixMonths] = 15_000;
        durationToMultiplier[StakingDuration.OneYear] = 30_000;
```

It is very clear that multipliers are not good. It is better for a user to do 4 stake in 1 year than to do it all at once. But let's give an example:

For simplicity, let's assume the following parameters and conditions:
1 ETH = 1000 $VVV (just for this example). Let's say you plan to stake 100 ETH:

Option 1: Staking 100 ETH for 3 Months:
- **Rewards** = 100 * 1000 * 10,000 / 10,000 = 100,000 $VVV

Option 2: Staking 100 ETH for 12 Months:
- **Rewards** = 100 * 1000 * 30,000 / 10,000 = 300,000 $VVV

Option 1: Each 3-month period yields 100,000 $VVV. Over four periods (a year), this equals 400,000 $VVV.

Option 2: For a Single 12-Month Stake: Yields 300,000 $VVV in a year.

It can be seen that with the same amount of tokens staked for 1 year, one user will receive 100 000 tokens less than the other.
## Impact
Users might exploit the reward mechanism by frequently restaking in shorter intervals or by using multiple accounts. This will give him an unfair advantage over other users, and he will earn more tokens than a normal user who stake for 6/12 months.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Instead of linear multipliers based on staking duration, implement a progressive scaling system where the increase in rewards for longer-term staking grows at a higher rate than the linear progression. This could be achieved by adjusting the multipliers or adding bonus rewards that become significant for longer staking durations.
