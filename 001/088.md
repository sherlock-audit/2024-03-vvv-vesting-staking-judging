# Re-stakingEth will nullify the user’s entitlement to previously accrued VVV tokens

## Summary
restakingEth nullifies the user’s entitlement to previously accrued VVV tokens
## Vulnerability Detail
User stakes their ETH and wait until the end time to claim their rewards, hoping to maximize their earnings instead of claiming in smaller amounts. However, if the user restakes their ETH before claiming their rewards at the end time, they won't receive any rewards. This is because restaking uses the user's staked ETH and assigns a new stakeid. Since the rewards are tied to the original stakeid, The old stakeid amount will be 0. When the user calls ``claimVvv``they won't be getting any, the accrued VVV tokens are calculated based on the following formula:

nominalAccruedEth = (secondsStaked * _stake.stakedEthAmount) / stakeDuration
