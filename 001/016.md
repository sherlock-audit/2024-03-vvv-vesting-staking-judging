# Stakers actively using this protocol may encounter a future DoS risk in the `claimVvv` function, stemming from the non-shrinking `_userStakeIds` array in the `VVVETHStaking` contract.

## Summary
The `claimVvv` function in the `VVVETHStaking` contract is at risk of a Denial of Service (DoS) due to the ever-growing `_userStakeIds` array. This array, which tracks all stake IDs for a user, is iterated over by `calculateAccruedVvvAmount` during the claim process, including stakes that have been withdrawn. As the array size increases, so does the gas cost, potentially leading to failed transactions due to block gas limits in the future.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `_userStakeIds` array is used to track users staking data, and each stake is appended to each time a user creates a new stake:

```solidity
    function _stakeEth(StakingDuration _stakeDuration, uint256 _stakedEthAmount) private {
        if (_stakedEthAmount == 0) revert CantStakeZeroEth();
        ++stakeId;

        userStakes[msg.sender][stakeId] = StakeData({
            stakedEthAmount: uint224(_stakedEthAmount),
            stakeStartTimestamp: uint32(block.timestamp),
            stakeIsWithdrawn: false,
            stakeDuration: _stakeDuration
        });

@-->    _userStakeIds[msg.sender].push(stakeId);
```

This array does not decrease in size when a stake is withdrawn, resulting in an ever-growing array. The `calculateAccruedVvvAmount` function, which is invoked within `claimVvv`, iterates through every stake ID in `_userStakeIds`. It does not distinguish between active and withdrawn stakes, leading to unnecessary computation and increased gas costs. Should the gas required for this operation approach or exceed the block gas limit, the transaction will fail and revert, preventing users from claiming their accrued $VVV.

```solidity
    function calculateAccruedVvvAmount() public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256[] memory stakeIds = _userStakeIds[msg.sender];
        if (stakeIds.length == 0) return 0;

        uint256 totalVvvAccrued;
@-->    for (uint256 i = 0; i < stakeIds.length; ++i) {
            StakeData memory stake = userStakes[msg.sender][stakeIds[i]];
            unchecked {
                totalVvvAccrued += calculateAccruedVvvAmount(stake);
            }
        }
```

## Impact
As the `_userStakeIds` array grows, the gas cost for executing the `claimVvv` function increases. This is due to the need to iterate over an increasing number of elements, which involves reading from storage and performing calculations for each stake. For users with a history of numerous stakes, this could lead to prohibitively high gas costs. In future, if the required gas surpasses the block gas limit, the function call will fail, preventing users from claiming their accrued $VVV.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this issue, it is recommended to implement a mechanism to manage the size of the `_userStakeIds` array. One approach could be to introduce a new array, such as `_userUnstaked`, to track unstaked stakes. When a user unstakes, the corresponding stake ID could be moved from `_userStakeIds` to `_userUnstaked`.
