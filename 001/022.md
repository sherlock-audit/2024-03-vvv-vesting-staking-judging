# MrMorningstar - Inaccurate calculation in `calculateAccruedVvvAmount::accruedVvv` making whole contract and protocol return invalid values

## Summary
Inaccurate calculation of `accruedVvv`  not returning correct amount or unit.
## Vulnerability Detail
`accruedVvv` in `calculateAccruedVvvAmount` function doesn't calculate correctly accrued amount of VVV.
## Impact
It is impacting the whole contract an possibly whole protocol with inaccurate data.
## Code Snippet
Here is the current way how it is calculated:
```javascript
            accruedVvv =
                (nominalAccruedEth * ethToVvvExchangeRate() * durationToMultiplier[_stake.stakeDuration]) /
                DENOMINATOR;
```

Proof of code:
For the simplicity sake I will use following params for this example:
`nominalAccruedEth` = 1 ETH
`ethToVvvExchangeRate` = 1 ETH/VVV
`durationToMultiplier[StakingDuration.ThreeMonths] ` = 10_000
`DENOMINATOR` = 10_000
Here is the picture to visually explain math and why it is wrong:

## Recommendation
Solution:
```diff
-            accruedVvv =
-               (nominalAccruedEth * ethToVvvExchangeRate() * durationToMultiplier[_stake.stakeDuration]) /
-                DENOMINATOR;
+            accruedVvv =
+                (nominalAccruedEth * 1/ethToVvvExchangeRate() * durationToMultiplier[_stake.stakeDuration]) /
+                DENOMINATOR;
```
