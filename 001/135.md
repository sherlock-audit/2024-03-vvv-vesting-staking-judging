## Summary
The restakeEth function allows users to stake ETH without actually sending any ETH to the contract. This function takes the stakeId and duration parameter, creating new  stakes and withdrawing the former stake. The vulnerability lies in the fact that a user call restake multiple times and accumulate multiple stakes, which can accrue vvv tokens without sending any extra Eth.  They are able to claim the the tokens through the claimVVV()  function which doesn't check if a stake is withdrawn or not.

## Vulnerability Detail
The restakeEth() withdraws stake for the former ID. And creates new stake by calling _stakeEth(). 
```solidity
 function restakeEth(
        uint256 _stakeId,
        StakingDuration _stakeDuration
    ) external whenStakingIsPermitted returns (uint256) {
        StakeData storage stake = userStakes[msg.sender][_stakeId];
        _withdrawChecks(stake);
        stake.stakeIsWithdrawn = true;
       // users can restake multiple times, although they are unable to withdraw eth
       //users can accrue vvv tokens for empty stakes
        _stakeEth(_stakeDuration, stake.stakedEthAmount);
    
        return stakeId;
    }
```
-A user does this multiple times has about 100 withdrawn stakes and only one active stake.
-This stakes continue to accrue VVV tokens although withdrawn.
-The user then claims accrued VVV tokens for all the stakes.
## Impact
Unauthorized Staking: Users can exploit this vulnerability to stake without committing any ETH. This undermines the integrity of the staking system.
Unauthorized Rewards: Users can claim $VVV tokens without having genuinely staked any assets. This undermines the fairness of the reward distribution.
Inflation: Continued accrual of $VVV rewards for withdrawn stakes can inflate the total supply of $VVV tokens beyond the intended distribution.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
 function restakeEth(
        uint256 _stakeId,
        StakingDuration _stakeDuration
    ) external whenStakingIsPermitted returns (uint256) {
        StakeData storage stake = userStakes[msg.sender][_stakeId];
        _withdrawChecks(stake);
        stake.stakeIsWithdrawn = true;
       // users can restake multiple times, although they are unable to withdraw eth
       //users can accrue vvv tokens for empty stakes
        _stakeEth(_stakeDuration, stake.stakedEthAmount);
    
        return stakeId;
    }
```
```solidity
 function restakeEth(
        uint256 _stakeId,
        StakingDuration _stakeDuration
    ) external whenStakingIsPermitted returns (uint256) {
        StakeData storage stake = userStakes[msg.sender][_stakeId];
        _withdrawChecks(stake);
        stake.stakeIsWithdrawn = true;
       // users can restake multiple times, although they are unable to withdraw eth
       //users can accrue vvv tokens for empty stakes
        _stakeEth(_stakeDuration, stake.stakedEthAmount);
    
        return stakeId;
    }
 ```
```solidity
  function claimVvv(uint256 _vvvAmount) external {
        if (_vvvAmount == 0) revert CantClaimZeroVvv();

        uint256 claimableVvv = calculateClaimableVvvAmount();
        if (_vvvAmount > claimableVvv) revert InsufficientClaimableVvv();

        userVvvClaimed[msg.sender] += _vvvAmount;

        vvvToken.safeTransfer(msg.sender, _vvvAmount);

        emit VvvClaim(msg.sender, _vvvAmount);
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review, vs code

## Recommendation
Fresh stake should be made by calling stakeEth(), as such user are forced to send eth when making new stakes.
This requires to call withdrawstake() whenever they want to stop their stakes also.
