# Possibility of overlapped payout through frontrunning

medium

## Summary

if the transaction calling `setVestingSchedule` which will update the already initialized `vestingschedule` is sent through public RPC, malicious user can frontrun the transaction and may claim token multiple times.

## Vulnerability Detail

since `setVestingSchedule` and `batchSetVestingSchedule` do not check the previous state, as written in summary user can frontrun and claim token from the `vestingSchedule` which will be overwritten after the victim transaction.

## Impact

double spending of capital.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

add the check of previous state. for instance, instead of taking only the updated vesting schedule, take the "normal" previous state as input and check whether storage value is matching with that input.
