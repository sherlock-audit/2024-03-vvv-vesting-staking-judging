# Vested tokens must be claimed before updating existing vesting

## Summary
Currently admin can update existing vesting, however it doesn't transfer corresponding tokens to user before update.
Suppose following scenario:
1) 1000 tokens vested to User, time past so 500 tokens is eligible currently
2) Admin decides to reduce vested amount to 800 tokens. It's intended behaviour because it can be updated by admin
3) So admin must decide what value to set to `tokenAmountWithdrawn`. If set to current value of `0`, user can frontrun and claim 500 tokens for free. If set to `500`, it means user lost 500 tokens.

Either way, update works incorrectly on existing vestings.
