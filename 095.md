# Early Withdrawal Permitted (One Day Short)

## Summary
Function intended to validate withdrawal permissions contains a logical error. It incorrectly permits withdrawals when the ``block.timestamp`` is equal to the sum of the user’s ``stakeStartTimestamp`` and ``stakeDuration``. This condition fails to account for the full 90-day staking requirement, allowing users to withdraw one day early
## Vulnerability Detail
The function is designed to validate user withdrawal permissions by checking the time elapsed since the initial stake. It aims to prevent premature withdrawal attempts.
Consider this scenario: if the current `block.timestamp` is equal to the sum of the user's `stakeStartTimestamp` and `stakeDuration`, the transaction is permitted to proceed.
This condition implies that the user has completed a staking period of 89 days, just shy of the 90-day requirement.

To elaborate:

- A user commits ETH for a staking period of three months, which is equivalent to 90 days.
- The user is eligible to withdraw or re-stake their ETH only after this 90-day period has elapsed.
The due date for withdrawal is calculated as follows:
``if (block.timestamp < _stake.stakeStartTimestamp + durationToSeconds[_stake.stakeDuration]) {
    revert CantWithdrawBeforeStakeDuration();
}``
In this case, if the block.timestamp is less than the sum of stakeStartTimestamp and stakeDuration, the function will revert, indicating that the staking duration has not yet been met.
If, however, the block.timestamp is equal to stakeStartTimestamp plus stakeDuration (which would be on the 90th day), the transaction executes.
To ensure that the funds remain locked for the full duration, the following conditions should be used:
``if (block.timestamp <= _stake.stakeStartTimestamp + durationToSeconds[_stake.stakeDuration]) {
    revert CantWithdrawBeforeStakeDuration();
}``
This adjustment guarantees that the user’s funds are only accessible for withdrawal or re-staking after the full 90-day threshold has been reached.

## Impact
Allows premature withdrawal due to timestamp miscalculation

## Recommendation
if (block.timestamp <= _stake.stakeStartTimestamp + durationToSeconds[_stake.stakeDuration]) {
            revert CantWithdrawBeforeStakeDuration();
