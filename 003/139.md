# `calculateVestedAmountAtInterval()` could give inflated vesting amount due to rounding issues

## Summary
`calculateVestedAmountAtInterval()` doesn't completely round down the vesting amount which could give inflate vesting amount to caller in every withdrawal

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
    function calculateVestedAmountAtInterval(
        uint256 _firstIntervalAccrual,
        uint256 _elapsedIntervals,
        uint256 _growthRateProportion
    ) public pure returns (uint256) {
        if (_growthRateProportion == 0 || _elapsedIntervals == 0) {
            return _firstIntervalAccrual * _elapsedIntervals;
        } else {
            uint256 r;
            uint256 rToN;
            uint256 Sn;
            unchecked {
                // Convert growth rate proportion to a fixed-point number with 1e18 scale
                r = FixedPointMathLib.divWadDown(
                    _growthRateProportion + FixedPointMathLib.WAD,
                    FixedPointMathLib.WAD
                );

                // Calculate r^n
                rToN = FixedPointMathLib.rpow(r, _elapsedIntervals, FixedPointMathLib.WAD);

                // Calculate the sum of the geometric series
                Sn = _firstIntervalAccrual.mulWadDown((rToN - FixedPointMathLib.WAD)).divWadDown(
                    r - FixedPointMathLib.WAD
                );//@audit-issue rounding issue which will leak vested amount
            }
            return Sn;
        }
    }

`calculateVestedAmountAtInterval` calculates the total amount of vested $VVV tokens for linear and exponential vesting schedules, based on the following formula  `{ a ( (1+r)^n -1 ) / r } `but using fixed point arithmetic. 

We want to round down the whole expression which can be done by
1. Numerator should be round down or don't round up
2. Denominator should be round up or don't round down
3. Numerator/Denominator should be round down or don't round up
 
> Instead of leaving denominator as it is or round up current implementation round down the denominator which will give the inflated vested amount

**Current implementation**
1. calculates (r+1) as `r` in the code which round down. 
2. calculates (r+1)^n as `rToN` 
3. calculates the final vested amount as `Sn` in which it first compute ` a ( (1+r)^n -1 )` which is rounded down as it should be. But then it calculated `r` by `r-1` (since in code r is r+1 so to find original rate r we need to find `(r in code) -1 ` which is rounded down since earlier we used same r to find numerator

In simple words

`We used same rounded down r to compute denominator which was used in Numerator but both share different properties resulting in Denominator round down and hence inflated vested amount`




## Impact
vested amount leakage on most of the withdrawal

## Recommendation

Use `_growthRateProportion` to compute Denominator in the same it has been in Numerator instead of rounded down `r's` value
