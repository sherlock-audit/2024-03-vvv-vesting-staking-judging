# stakeEth() maybe returns incorrect stakeId

## Summary
In a not good network conditions, users are unable to match stackId with specific transactions, especially called in a dApp.
## Vulnerability Detail
Users may call` stakeEth()` multiple times in a short period of time, and due to blockchain delayed confirmation, their returned stakeIDs may not correspond to the order of transactions.
Example: Tom stakes 0.5 ETH for the first time and then stakes 100 ETH, both pledging for one year. However, due to the latency of blockchain, a stakeId of 100ETH is returned first, followed by a tokenId of 0.5ETH, but Tom  gets it wrong:  he thinks the first tokenId is of 0.5ETH and the second is of 100ETH.
One year later, Tom wants to restake 0.5 ETH again by `restakeEth()` and retrieve 100 ETH. But he calles `restakeEth()` with the incorrect tokenId. He is unable to retrieve 100 ETH again until one year later. He can only retrieves 0.5ETH.
```solidity
    function stakeEth(
        StakingDuration _stakeDuration
    ) external payable whenStakingIsPermitted returns (uint256) {
        _stakeEth(_stakeDuration, msg.value);
        return stakeId;
    }
    
    function restakeEth(
        uint256 _stakeId,
        StakingDuration _stakeDuration
    ) external whenStakingIsPermitted returns (uint256) {
        StakeData storage stake = userStakes[msg.sender][_stakeId];
        _withdrawChecks(stake);
        stake.stakeIsWithdrawn = true;
        _stakeEth(_stakeDuration, stake.stakedEthAmount);
        return stakeId;
    }
```
## Impact
The user mistakenly matched the `stakeId` with the transaction

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
return stakeId and the amount of staking:
```solidity
    function stakeEth(
        StakingDuration _stakeDuration
    ) external payable whenStakingIsPermitted returns (uint256, uint256) {
        _stakeEth(_stakeDuration, msg.value);
        return (stakeId, msg.value);
    }
```
