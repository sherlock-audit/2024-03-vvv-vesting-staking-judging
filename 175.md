# `VVVETHStaking::_stakeEth` Unchecked Staking Duration Input Leading to Potential Misbehavior

## Summary
The `_stakeEth` function in the VVVETHStaking contract does not validate the `_stakeDuration` parameter against the defined `StakingDuration` enum values. This lack of validation could lead to undefined behavior if an invalid duration is passed.
## Vulnerability Detail
- The `_stakeEth` function accepts a StakingDuration parameter without checking if it corresponds to a valid enum value.
- Solidity enums do not inherently prevent out-of-range values.
- Users can input any uint8 value, potentially leading to incorrect behavior or storage of invalid stakes.

```solidity
    function _stakeEth(StakingDuration _stakeDuration, uint256 _stakedEthAmount) private {
        if (_stakedEthAmount == 0) revert CantStakeZeroEth();
        //@audit Unchecked Staking Duration Input Leading to Potential Misbehavior
        ++stakeId;

        userStakes[msg.sender][stakeId] = StakeData({
            stakedEthAmount: uint224(_stakedEthAmount),
            stakeStartTimestamp: uint32(block.timestamp),
            stakeIsWithdrawn: false,
            stakeDuration: _stakeDuration
        });

        _userStakeIds[msg.sender].push(stakeId);

        emit Stake(
            msg.sender,
            stakeId,
            uint224(_stakedEthAmount),
            uint32(block.timestamp),
            _stakeDuration
        );
    }
```

### POC 
A user can call the stakeEth function with an invalid enum value such as 3 (or any value outside 0, 1, 2), which is not mapped to any defined staking duration.

## Impact
Stakes with invalid durations can lead to incorrect reward calculations.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a validation check in _stakeEth to ensure _stakeDuration is within the range of the StakingDuration enum.

eg - 

```solidity 
modifier validStakingDuration(StakingDuration _duration) {
    require(
        _duration == StakingDuration.ThreeMonths ||
        _duration == StakingDuration.SixMonths ||
        _duration == StakingDuration.OneYear,
        "Invalid staking duration"
    );
    _;
}
```
And then add it in the _stakeETH function - 
```solidity 
function _stakeEth(StakingDuration _stakeDuration, uint256 _stakedEthAmount) private validStakingDuration(_stakeDuration) {
    // ... existing code ...
}
```
